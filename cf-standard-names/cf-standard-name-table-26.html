<b>
A note about units
</b>
<br>
The canonical units associated with each standard name are usually the SI units for the quantity.
<a href="http://cf-convention.github.io/1.6.html#standard-name">
Section 3.3 of the CF conventions
</a>
states: "Unless it is dimensionless, a variable with a standard_name 
attribute must have units which are physically equivalent (not 
necessarily identical) to the canonical units, possibly modified by an 
operation specified by either the standard name modifier ... or by the 
cell_methods attribute." Furthermore, 
<a href="http://cf-convention.github.io/1.6.html#idp4625472">
Section 1.3 of the CF conventions
</a>
states: "The values of the units attributes are character strings that 
are recognized by UNIDATA's Udunits package [UDUNITS], (with exceptions 
allowed as discussed in Section 3.1, “Units”)." For example, a variable 
with the standard name of "air_temperature" may have a units attribute 
of "degree_Celsius" because Celsius can be converted to Kelvin by 
Udunits. For the full range of supported units, refer to the 
<a href="http://www.unidata.ucar.edu/software/udunits/udunits-2-units.html">
Udunits documentation
</a>
. Refer to the 
<a href="http://cf-convention.github.io/latest.html">
CF conventions
</a>
for full details of the units attribute.

from the change in the global average sea surface height relative to the
centre of the Earth by the global average vertical movement of the 
ocean floor. Zero sea level change is an arbitrary level. Amplitude is 
the magnitude of a wave modelled by a sinusoidal function. A coordinate

quantity refers to the vertical integral from the surface to the top of 
the atmosphere. For the content between specified levels in the 
atmosphere, standard names including content_of_atmosphere_layer are 
used. Dry energy is the sum of dry static energy and kinetic energy. Dry
static energy is the sum of enthalpy and potential energy (itself the 
sum of gravitational and centripetal potential energy). Enthalpy can be 
written either as (1) CpT, where Cp is heat capacity at constant 
pressure, T is absolute temperature, or (2) U+pV, where U is internal 
energy, p is pressure and V is volume.

"change_over_time_in_X"
means change in a quantity X over a time-interval, which should be 
defined by the bounds of the time coordinate. Sea water salinity is the 
salt content of sea water, often on the Practical Salinity Scale of 
1978. However, the unqualified term 'salinity' is generic and does not 
necessarily imply any particular method of calculation. The units of 
salinity are dimensionless and the units attribute should normally be 
given as 1e-3 or 0.001 i.e. parts per thousand. There are standard names
for the more precisely defined salinity quantities: 
sea_water_knudsen_salinity, S_K (used for salinity observations between 
1901 and 1966), sea_water_cox_salinity, S_C (used for salinity 
observations between 1967 and 1977), sea_water_practical_salinity, S_P 
(used for salinity observations from 1978 to the present day), 
sea_water_absolute_salinity, S_A, sea_water_preformed_salinity, S_*, and
sea_water_reference_salinity. Practical Salinity is reported on the 
Practical Salinity Scale of 1978 (PSS-78), and is usually based on the 
electrical conductivity of sea water in observations since the 1960s. 
Conversion of data between the observed scales follows: S_P = (S_K - 
0.03) * (1.80655 / 1.805) and S_P = S_C, however the accuracy of the 
latter is dependent on whether chlorinity or conductivity was used to 
determine the S_C value, with this inconsistency driving the development
of PSS-78. The more precise standard names should be used where 
appropriate for both modelled and observed salinities. In particular, 
the use of sea_water_salinity to describe salinity observations made 
from 1978 onwards is now deprecated in favor of the term 
sea_water_practical_salinity which is the salinity quantity stored by 
national data centers for post-1978 observations. The only exception to 
this is where the observed salinities are definitely known not to be 
recorded on the Practical Salinity Scale. The unit "parts per thousand" 
was used for sea_water_knudsen_salinity and sea_water_cox_salinity.

sea_surface_subskin_temperature and sea_surface_foundation_temperature 
which can be used to describe data located at the specified surfaces. 
For observed data, depending on the period during which the observation 
was made, the measured in situ temperature was recorded against standard
"scales". These historical scales include the International Practical 
Temperature Scale of 1948 (IPTS-48; 1948-1967), the International 
Practical Temperature Scale of 1968 (IPTS-68, Barber, 1969; 1968-1989) 
and the International Temperature Scale of 1990 (ITS-90, Saunders 1990; 
1990 onwards). Conversion of data between these scales follows t68 = t48
- (4.4 x 10e-6) * t48(100 - t - 48); t90 = 0.99976 * t68. Observations 
made prior to 1948 (IPTS-48) have not been documented and therefore a 
conversion cannot be certain. Differences between t90 and t68 can be up 
to 0.01 at temperatures of 40 C and above; differences of 0.002-0.007 
occur across the standard range of ocean temperatures (-10 - 30 C). The 
International Equation of State of Seawater 1980 (EOS-80, UNESCO, 1981)

the observation was made, the measured in situ temperature was recorded 
against standard "scales". These historical scales include the 
International Practical Temperature Scale of 1948 (IPTS-48; 1948-1967), 
the International Practical Temperature Scale of 1968 (IPTS-68, Barber, 
1969; 1968-1989) and the International Temperature Scale of 1990 
(ITS-90, Saunders 1990; 1990 onwards). Conversion of data between these 
scales follows t68 = t48 - (4.4 x 10e-6) * t48(100 - t - 48); t90 = 
0.99976 * t68. Observations made prior to 1948 (IPTS-48) have not been 
documented and therefore a conversion cannot be certain. Differences 
between t90 and t68 can be up to 0.01 at temperatures of 40 C and above;
differences of 0.002-0.007 occur across the standard range of ocean 
temperatures (-10 - 30 C). The International Equation of State of 
Seawater 1980 (EOS-80, UNESCO, 1981) and the Practical Salinity Scale 
(PSS-78) were both based on IPTS-68, while the Thermodynamic Equation of
Seawater 2010 (TEOS-10) is based on ITS-90. References: Barber, 1969,

"tendency_of_X"
means derivative of X with respect to time. The Lagrangian tendency of a
quantity is its rate of change following the motion of the fluid, also 
called the "material derivative" or "convective derivative". The 
Lagrangian tendency of sigma plays the role of the upward component of 
air velocity when the atmosphere sigma coordinate (a dimensionless 
atmosphere vertical coordinate) is being used as the vertical 
coordinate. If the vertical air velocity is upwards, it is negative when
expressed as a tendency of sigma; downwards is positive. See Appendix D
of the CF convention for information about dimensionless vertical 
coordinates.

constituent of Y.  A chemical or biological species denoted by X may be 
described by a single term such as 'nitrogen' or a phrase such as 
'nox_expressed_as_nitrogen'. Chlorophylls are the green pigments found 
in most plants, algae and cyanobacteria; their presence is essential for
photosynthesis to take place. There are several different forms of 
chlorophyll that occur naturally. All contain a chlorin ring (chemical 
formula C20H16N4) which gives the green pigment and a side chain whose 
structure varies. The naturally occurring forms of chlorophyll contain 
between 35 and 55 carbon atoms. Chlorophyll-a is the most commonly 
occurring form of natural chlorophyll. The chemical formula of 
chlorophyll-a is C55H72O5N4Mg.

species consisting of inorganic chlorine compounds with the exception of
hydrogen chloride (HCl) and chlorine nitrate (ClONO2). "Clox" is the 
term used in standard names for all species belonging to the family that
are represented within a given model. The list of individual species 
that are included in a quantity with a group chemical standard name can 
vary between models.  Where possible, the data variable should be 
accompanied by a complete description of the species represented, for 
example, by using a comment attribute. "Inorganic chlorine", sometimes 
referred to as Cly, describes a family of chemical species which result 
from the degradation of source gases containing chlorine (CFCs, HCFCs, 
VSLS) and natural inorganic chlorine sources such as seasalt and other 
aerosols.   Standard names that use the term "inorganic_chlorine" are 
used for quantities that contain all inorganic chlorine species 
including HCl and ClONO2. The phrase 'expressed_as' is used in the 
construction A_expressed_as_B, where B is a chemical constituent of A. 
It means that the quantity indicated by the standard name is calculated 
solely with respect to the B contained in A, neglecting all other 
chemical constituents of A.

mole_content_of_ozone_in_atmosphere_layer
"Content"
indicates a quantity per unit area. The 
"content_of_X_in_atmosphere_layer" refers to the vertical integral 
between two specified levels in the atmosphere. "Layer" means any layer 
with upper and lower boundaries that have constant values in some 
vertical coordinate. There must be a vertical coordinate variable 
indicating the extent of the layer(s). If the layers are model layers, 
the vertical coordinate can be model_level_number, but it is recommended
to specify a physical coordinate (in a scalar or auxiliary coordinate 
variable) as well. For the mole content integrated from the surface to 
the top of the atmosphere, standard names including 
"atmosphere_mole_content_of_X" are used. The chemical formula for ozone 
is O3. "mole_content_of_ozone_in_atmosphere_layer" is usually measured 
in Dobson Units which are equivalent to 446.2 micromoles m-2. N.B. Data 
variables containing column content of ozone can be given the standard 
name of either equivalent_thickness_at_stp_of_atmosphere_ozone_content 
or atmosphere_mole_content_of_ozone. The latter name is recommended for 
consistency with mole content names for chemical species other than 
ozone.

"Normalized_difference_vegetation_index",
usually abbreviated to NDVI, is an index calculated from reflectances 
measured in the visible and near infrared channels.  It is calculated as
NDVI = (NIR - R) / (NIR + R) where NIR is the reflectance in the 
near-infrared band and R is the reflectance in the red visible band.  
Reflectance is the ratio of the reflected over the incoming radiation in
each spectral band.  The calculated value of NDVI depends on the 
precise definitions of the spectral bands and these definitions may vary
between different models and remote sensing instruments.

indicates a vector component which is positive when directed northward 
(negative southward). Transport across_unit_distance means expressed per
unit distance normal to the direction of transport. Dry static energy 
is the sum of enthalpy and potential energy (itself the sum of 
gravitational and centripetal potential energy). Enthalpy can be written
either as (1) CpT, where Cp is heat capacity at constant pressure, T is
absolute temperature, or (2) U+pV, where U is internal energy, p is 
pressure and V is volume.

position of an object that has moved over time. If possible, the time 
interval over which the motion took place should be specified using a 
bounds variable for the time coordinate variable.  A displacement can be
represented as a vector. Such a vector should however not be 
interpreted as describing a rectilinear, constant speed motion but 
merely as an indication that the start point of the vector is found at 
the tip of the vector after the time interval associated with the 
displacement variable.  A displacement does not prescribe a trajectory. 
Sea ice displacement can be defined as a two-dimensional vector, with no
vertical component. A northward displacement is the distance calculated
from the change in a moving object's latitude between the start and end
of the time interval associated with the displacement variable.

ocean_integral_of_sea_water_temperature_wrt_depth
"integral_of_Y_wrt_X"
means int Y dX. The data variable should have an axis for X specifying 
the limits of the integral as bounds. "wrt" means with respect to. Depth
is the vertical distance below the surface. Sea water temperature is 
the in situ temperature of the sea water. For observed data, depending 
on the period during which the observation was made, the measured in 
situ temperature was recorded against standard "scales". These 
historical scales include the International Practical Temperature Scale 
of 1948 (IPTS-48; 1948-1967), the International Practical Temperature 
Scale of 1968 (IPTS-68, Barber, 1969; 1968-1989) and the International 
Temperature Scale of 1990 (ITS-90, Saunders 1990; 1990 onwards). 
Conversion of data between these scales follows t68 = t48 - (4.4 x 
10e-6) * t48(100 - t - 48); t90 = 0.99976 * t68. Observations made prior
to 1948 (IPTS-48) have not been documented and therefore a conversion 
cannot be certain. Differences between t90 and t68 can be up to 0.01 at 
temperatures of 40 C and above; differences of 0.002-0.007 occur across 
the standard range of ocean temperatures (-10 - 30 C). The International
Equation of State of Seawater 1980 (EOS-80, UNESCO, 1981) and the 
Practical Salinity Scale (PSS-78) were both based on IPTS-68, while the 
Thermodynamic Equation of Seawater 2010 (TEOS-10) is based on ITS-90.

the Practical Salinity Scale of 1978. However, the unqualified term 
'salinity' is generic and does not necessarily imply any particular 
method of calculation. The units of salinity are dimensionless and 
normally given as 1e-3 or 0.001 i.e. parts per thousand. There are 
standard names for the more precisely defined salinity quantities: 
sea_water_knudsen_salinity, S_K (used for salinity observations between 
1901 and 1966), sea_water_cox_salinity, S_C (used for salinity 
observations between 1967 and 1977), sea_water_practical_salinity, S_P 
(used for salinity observations from 1978 to the present day), 
sea_water_absolute_salinity, S_A, sea_water_preformed_salinity, S_*, and
sea_water_reference_salinity. Practical Salinity is reported on the 
Practical Salinity Scale of 1978 (PSS-78), and is usually based on the 
electrical conductivity of sea water in observations since the 1960s. 
Conversion of data between the observed scales follows: S_P = (S_K - 
0.03) * (1.80655 / 1.805) and S_P = S_C, however the accuracy of the 
latter is dependent on whether chlorinity or conductivity was used to 
determine the S_C value, with this inconsistency driving the development
of PSS-78. The more precise standard names should be used where 
appropriate for both modelled and observed salinities. In particular, 
the use of sea_water_salinity to describe salinity observations made 
from 1978 onwards is now deprecated in favor of the term 
sea_water_practical_salinity which is the salinity quantity stored by 
national data centers for post-1978 observations. The only exception to 
this is where the observed salinities are definitely known not to be 
recorded on the Practical Salinity Scale. The unit "parts per thousand" 
was used for sea_water_knudsen_salinity and sea_water_cox_salinity.

means X*Y. A velocity is a vector quantity. "Northward" indicates a 
vector component which is positive when directed northward (negative

on the Practical Salinity Scale of 1978. However, the unqualified term 
'salinity' is generic and does not necessarily imply any particular 
method of calculation. The units of salinity are dimensionless and 
normally given as 1e-3 or 0.001 i.e. parts per thousand. There are 
standard names for the more precisely defined salinity quantities: 
sea_water_knudsen_salinity, S_K (used for salinity observations between 
1901 and 1966), sea_water_cox_salinity, S_C (used for salinity 
observations between 1967 and 1977), sea_water_practical_salinity, S_P 
(used for salinity observations from 1978 to the present day), 
sea_water_absolute_salinity, S_A, sea_water_preformed_salinity, S_*, and
sea_water_reference_salinity. Practical Salinity is reported on the 
Practical Salinity Scale of 1978 (PSS-78), and is usually based on the 
electrical conductivity of sea water in observations since the 1960s. 
Conversion of data between the observed scales follows: S_P = (S_K - 
0.03) * (1.80655 / 1.805) and S_P = S_C, however the accuracy of the 
latter is dependent on whether chlorinity or conductivity was used to 
determine the S_C value, with this inconsistency driving the development
of PSS-78. The more precise standard names should be used where 
appropriate for both modelled and observed salinities. In particular, 
the use of sea_water_salinity to describe salinity observations made 
from 1978 onwards is now deprecated in favor of the term 
sea_water_practical_salinity which is the salinity quantity stored by 
national data centers for post-1978 observations. The only exception to 
this is where the observed salinities are definitely known not to be 
recorded on the Practical Salinity Scale. The unit "parts per thousand" 
was used for sea_water_knudsen_salinity and sea_water_cox_salinity.

sea_surface_foundation_temperature
The
surface called "surface" means the lower boundary of the atmosphere. 
The sea surface foundation temperature is the water temperature that is 
not influenced by a thermally stratified layer of diurnal temperature 
variability (either by daytime warming or nocturnal cooling). The 
foundation temperature is named to indicate that it is the temperature 
from which the growth of the diurnal thermocline develops each day, 
noting that on some occasions with a deep mixed layer there is no clear 
foundation temperature in the surface layer. In general, sea surface 
foundation temperature will be similar to a night time minimum or 
pre-dawn value at depths of between approximately 1 and 5 meters. In the
absence of any diurnal signal, the foundation temperature is considered
equivalent to the quantity with standard name 
sea_surface_subskin_temperature. The sea surface foundation temperature 
defines a level in the upper water column that varies in depth, space, 
and time depending on the local balance between thermal stratification 
and turbulent energy and is expected to change slowly over the course of
a day. If possible, a data variable with the standard name 
sea_surface_foundation_temperature should be used with a scalar vertical
coordinate variable to specify the depth of the foundation level. Sea 
surface foundation temperature is measured at the base of the diurnal 
thermocline or as close to the water surface as possible in the absence 
of thermal stratification. Only in situ contact thermometry is able to 
measure the sea surface foundation temperature. Analysis procedures must
be used to estimate sea surface foundation temperature value from 
radiometric satellite measurements of the quantities with standard names
sea_surface_skin_temperature and sea_surface_subskin_temperature.  Sea 
surface foundation temperature provides a connection with the historical
concept of a "bulk" sea surface temperature considered representative 
of the oceanic mixed layer temperature that is typically represented by 
any sea temperature measurement within the upper ocean over a depth 
range of 1 to approximately 20 meters. The general term, "bulk" sea 
surface temperature, has the standard name sea_surface_temperature with 
no associated vertical coordinate axis. Sea surface foundation 
temperature provides a more precise, well-defined quantity than "bulk" 
sea surface temperature and, consequently, is more representative of the
mixed layer temperature.  The temperature of sea water at a particular 
depth (other than the foundation level) should be reported using the 
standard name sea_water_temperature and, wherever possible, supplying a 
vertical coordinate axis or scalar coordinate variable.

sea_surface_salinity
Sea
surface salinity is the salt content of sea water close to the sea 
surface, often on the Practical Salinity Scale of 1978. However, the 
unqualified term 'salinity' is generic and does not necessarily imply 
any particular method of calculation. The units of salinity are 
dimensionless and the units attribute should normally be given as 1e-3 
or 0.001 i.e. parts per thousand. Sea surface salinity is often 
abbreviated as "SSS". For the salinity of sea water at a particular 
depth or layer, a data variable of "sea_water_salinity" or one of the 
more precisely defined salinities should be used with a vertical 
coordinate axis. There are standard names for the precisely defined 
salinity quantities: sea_water_knudsen_salinity, S_K (used for salinity 
observations between 1901 and 1966), sea_water_cox_salinity, S_C (used 
for salinity observations between 1967 and 1977), 
sea_water_practical_salinity, S_P (used for salinity observations from 
1978 to the present day), sea_water_absolute_salinity, S_A, 
sea_water_preformed_salinity, S_*, and sea_water_reference_salinity. 
Practical Salinity is reported on the Practical Salinity Scale of 1978 
(PSS-78), and is usually based on the electrical conductivity of sea 
water in observations since the 1960s. Conversion of data between the 
observed scales follows: S_P = (S_K - 0.03) * (1.80655 / 1.805) and S_P =
S_C, however the accuracy of the latter is dependent on whether 
chlorinity or conductivity was used to determine the S_C value, with 
this inconsistency driving the development of PSS-78. The more precise 
standard names should be used where appropriate for both modelled and 
observed salinities. In particular, the use of sea_water_salinity to 
describe salinity observations made from 1978 onwards is now deprecated 
in favor of the term sea_water_practical_salinity which is the salinity 
quantity stored by national data centers for post-1978 observations. The
only exception to this is where the observed salinities are definitely 
known not to be recorded on the Practical Salinity Scale. The unit 
"parts per thousand" was used for sea_water_knudsen_salinity and 
sea_water_cox_salinity.

diffusion-dominated sub-layer at a depth of approximately 10 - 20 
micrometers below the air-sea interface. Measurements of this quantity 
are subject to a large potential diurnal cycle including cool skin layer

For practical purposes, this quantity can be well approximated to the 
measurement of surface temperature by a microwave radiometer operating 
in the 6 - 11 gigahertz frequency range, but the relationship is neither
direct nor invariant to changing physical conditions or to the specific
geometry of the microwave measurements. Measurements of this quantity

Absolute
Salinity, S_A, is defined as part of the Thermodynamic Equation of

fraction of dissolved material in sea water. Absolute Salinity

This type of Absolute Salinity is also called "Density Salinity". 
TEOS-10 estimates Absolute Salinity as the salinity variable that, when 
used with the TEOS-10 expression for density, yields the correct density
of a sea water sample even when the sample is not of Reference 
Composition. In practice, Absolute Salinity is often calculated from 
Practical Salinity using a spatial lookup table of pre-defined values of
the Absolute Salinity Anomaly. It is recommended that the version of 
(TEOS-10) software and the associated Absolute Salinity Anomaly 
climatology be specified within metadata by attaching a comment 
attribute to the data variable. Reference: www.teos-10.org; Millero et

Chlorinity, Cl, is calculated from the conductivity of a sea water

Knudsen
Salinity, S_K, is defined unitless as a mass fraction per mil (0/00) or
"parts per thousand", and was calculated from the titration of 
inorganic salts from a sample of sea water after a commission to study 
the problem of determining salinity and density was initiated by the 
International Council for the Exploration of the Sea (ICES) in 1899. S_K
was the standard salinity measure until S_C (Cox Salinity) was 
established in 1967. Since the work of Knudsen (1901), chlorinity is 
converted into Knudsen Salinity using S_K = 0.030 + 1.805 Cl. This type 
of salinity was called simply "salinity" from 1901 to 1966. From the 
1960s on, electrical conductivity began to be used to estimate the 
Knudsen Salinity, rather than chemical titration. Knudsen Salinity was 
replaced by Cox Salinity in 1967 which was in turn replaced by Practical
Salinity, S_P, in 1978. Conversion of Knudsen Salinity to Practical 
Salinity follows S_P = (S_K - 0.03) * (1.80655 / 1.805). Reference:

sea_water_salinity
Sea
water salinity is the salt content of sea water, often on the Practical
Salinity Scale of 1978. However, the unqualified term 'salinity' is 
generic and does not necessarily imply any particular method of 
calculation. The units of salinity are dimensionless and the units 
attribute should normally be given as 1e-3 or 0.001 i.e. parts per 
thousand. There are standard names for the more precisely defined 
salinity quantities: sea_water_knudsen_salinity, S_K (used for salinity 
observations between 1901 and 1966),  sea_water_cox_salinity, S_C (used 
for salinity observations between 1967 and 1977), 
sea_water_practical_salinity, S_P (used for salinity observations from 
1978 to the present day), sea_water_absolute_salinity, S_A, 
sea_water_preformed_salinity, S_*, and sea_water_reference_salinity. 
Practical Salinity is reported on the Practical Salinity Scale of 1978 
(PSS-78), and is usually based on the electrical conductivity of sea 
water in observations since the 1960s. Conversion of data between the 
observed scales follows: S_P = (S_K - 0.03) * (1.80655 / 1.805) and S_P =
S_C, however the accuracy of the latter is dependent on whether 
chlorinity or conductivity was used to determine the S_C value, with 
this inconsistency driving the development of PSS-78. The more precise 
standard names should be used where appropriate for both modelled and 
observed salinities. In particular, the use of sea_water_salinity to 
describe salinity observations made from 1978 onwards is now deprecated 
in favor of the term sea_water_practical_salinity which is the salinity 
quantity stored by national data centers for post-1978 observations. The
only exception to this is where the observed salinities are definitely 
known not to be recorded on the Practical Salinity Scale. The unit

sea_water_temperature
Sea
water temperature is the in situ temperature of the sea water. To 
specify the depth at which the temperature applies use a vertical 
coordinate variable or scalar coordinate variable. There are standard 
names for sea_surface_temperature, sea_surface_skin_temperature, 
sea_surface_subskin_temperature and sea_surface_foundation_temperature 
which can be used to describe data located at the specified surfaces. 
For observed data, depending on the period during which the observation 
was made, the measured in situ temperature was recorded against standard
"scales". These historical scales include the International Practical 
Temperature Scale of 1948 (IPTS-48; 1948-1967), the International 
Practical Temperature Scale of 1968 (IPTS-68, Barber, 1969; 1968-1989) 
and the International Temperature Scale of 1990 (ITS-90, Saunders 1990; 
1990 onwards). Conversion of data between these scales follows t68 = t48
- (4.4 x 10e-6) * t48(100 - t - 48); t90 = 0.99976 * t68. Observations 
made prior to 1948 (IPTS-48) have not been documented and therefore a 
conversion cannot be certain. Differences between t90 and t68 can be up 
to 0.01 at temperatures of 40 C and above; differences of 0.002-0.007 
occur across the standard range of ocean temperatures (-10 - 30 C). The 
International Equation of State of Seawater 1980 (EOS-80, UNESCO, 1981) 
and the Practical Salinity Scale (PSS-78) were both based on IPTS-68, 
while the Thermodynamic Equation of Seawater 2010 (TEOS-10) is based on 
ITS-90. References: Barber, 1969, doi: 10.1088/0026-1394/5/2/001;

"tendency_of_X"
means derivative of X with respect to time. "Content" indicates a 
quantity per unit area. The "atmosphere content" of a quantity refers to
the vertical integral from the surface to the top of the atmosphere. 
For the content between specified levels in the atmosphere, standard 
names including "content_of_atmosphere_layer" are used. The mass is the 
total mass of the molecules. The specification of a physical process by 
the phrase "due_to_" process means that the quantity named is a single 
term in a sum of terms which together compose the general quantity named
by omitting the phrase. "Emission" means emission from a primary source
located anywhere within the atmosphere, including at the lower boundary
(i.e. earth's surface). "Emission" is a process entirely distinct from 
"re-emission" which is used in some standard names. The chemical formula
for formaldehyde is CH2O. The IUPAC name for formaldehyde is methanal. 
The "residential and commercial combustion" sector comprises fuel 
combustion activities related to the commercial/institutional sector, 
the residential sector and the agriculture/forestry/fishing sector. It 
may also include any not-classified or "other" combustion, which is 
commonly included in the inventory data. "Residential and commercial 
combustion" is the term used in standard names to describe a collection 
of emission sources. A variable which has this value for the 
standard_name attribute should be accompanied by a comment attribute 
which lists the source categories and provides a reference to the 
categorization scheme, for example, "IPCC (Intergovernmental Panel on 
Climate Change) source categories 1A4a, 1A4b and 1A4c as defined in the 
2006 IPCC guidelines for national greenhouse gas inventories".

It excludes field burning of agricultural residues. "Savanna and 
grassland fires" is the term used in standard names to describe a 
collection of emission sources. A variable which has this value for the

"Content"
indicates a quantity per unit area.  The "atmosphere content" of a 
quantity refers to the vertical integral from the surface to the top of 
the atmosphere. For the content between specified levels in the 
atmosphere, standard names including content_of_atmosphere_layer are 
used.  "Aerosol" means the suspended liquid or solid particles in air 
(except cloud droplets).  The specification of a physical process by the
phrase due_to_process means that the quantity named is a  single term 
ina sum of terms which together compose the general quantity  named by 
omitting the phrase."tendency_of_X" means derivative of X  with respect 
to time.  "Dry deposition" is the sum of turbulent deposition and

"tendency_of_X"
means derivative of X with respect to time. "Content" indicates a 
quantity per unit area. The "atmosphere content" of a quantity refers to
the vertical integral from the surface to the top of the atmosphere. 
For the content between specified levels in the atmosphere, standard 
names including "content_of_atmosphere_layer" are used. The mass is the 
total mass of the molecules. The specification of a physical process by 
the phrase "due_to_" process means that the quantity named is a single 
term in a sum of terms which together compose the general quantity named
by omitting the phrase. "Emission" means emission from a primary source
located anywhere within the atmosphere, including at the lower boundary
(i.e. earth's surface). "Emission" is a process entirely distinct from 
"re-emission" which is used in some standard names. An organic acid is 
an organic compound with acidic properties. The most common organic 
acids are the carboxylic acids, whose acidity is associated with their 
carboxyl group -COOH. In standard names "organic_acids" is the term used
to describe the group of organic acid species that are represented 
within a given model. The list of individual species that are included 
in a quantity having a group chemical standard name can vary between 
models. Where possible, the data variable should be accompanied by a 
complete description of the species represented, for example, by using a
comment attribute. The "savanna and grassland fires" sector comprises 
the burning (natural and human-induced) of living or dead vegetation in 
non-forested areas. It excludes field burning of agricultural residues. 
"Savanna and grassland fires" is the term used in standard names to 
describe a collection of emission sources. A variable which has this 
value for the standard_name attribute should be accompanied by a comment
attribute which lists the source categories and provides a reference to
the categorization scheme, for example, "IPCC (Intergovernmental Panel 
on Climate Change) source category 5 as defined in the 2006 IPCC 
guidelines for national greenhouse gas Inventories".

"Content"
indicates a quantity per unit area.  The "atmosphere content" of a 
quantity refers to the vertical integral from the surface to the top of 
the atmosphere. For the content between specified levels in the 
atmosphere, standard names including content_of_atmosphere_layer are 
used.  The specification of a physical process by the phrase 
due_to_process means that the quantity named is a  single term in a sum 
of terms which together compose the general quantity  named by omitting 
the phrase.  "tendency_of_X" means derivative of X with respect to time.
"Emission" means emission from a primary source located anywhere 
within the atmosphere, including at the lower boundary (i.e. earth's 
surface). "Emission" is a process entirely distinct from "re-emission" 
which is used in some standard names. The chemical formula for propane 
is C3H8. Propane is a member of the group of hydrocarbons known as 
alkanes.  There are standard names for the alkane group as well as for 
some of the individual species.

means derivative of X with respect to time. "Content" indicates a 
quantity per unit area. The "atmosphere content" of a quantity refers to
the vertical integral from the surface to the top of the atmosphere. 
For the content between specified levels in the atmosphere, standard 
names including "content_of_atmosphere_layer" are used. The mass is the 
total mass of the molecules. The specification of a physical process by 
the phrase "due_to_" process means that the quantity named is a single 
term in a sum of terms which together compose the general quantity named
by omitting the phrase. "Emission" means emission from a primary source
located anywhere within the atmosphere, including at the lower boundary
(i.e. earth's surface). "Emission" is a process entirely distinct from 
"re-emission" which is used in some standard names. The chemical formula
for propene is C3H6. Propene is a member of the group of hydrocarbons 
known as alkenes. There are standard names for the alkene group as well 
as for some of the individual species. The "industrial processes and 
combustion" sector comprises fuel combustion activities related to 
manufacturing industries and construction, industrial processes related 
to mineral products, the chemical industry, metal production, the 
production of pulp, paper, food and drink, and non-energy industry use 
of lubricants and waxes. It may also include any not-classified or 
"other" combustion, which is commonly included in industry-related 
inventory data. "Industrial processes and combustion" is the term used 
in standard names to describe a collection of emission sources. A 
variable which has this value for the standard_name attribute should be 
accompanied by a comment attribute which lists the source categories and
provides a reference to the categorization scheme, for example, "IPCC 
(Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change) source categories 1A2, 2A, 
2B, 2C, 2D and 2G as defined in the 2006 IPCC guidelines for national 
greenhouse gas inventories".

"Content"
indicates a quantity per unit area.  The "atmosphere content" of a 
quantity refers to the vertical integral from the surface to the top of 
the atmosphere. For the content between specified levels in the 
atmosphere, standard names including content_of_atmosphere_layer are 
used.  The phrase 'expressed_as' is used in the construction 
A_expressed_as_B, where B is a chemical constituent of A. It means that 
the quantity indicated by the standard name is calculated solely with 
respect to the B contained in A, neglecting all other chemical 
constituents of A. "Aerosol" means the suspended liquid or solid 
particles in air (except cloud droplets). Aerosol takes up ambient water
(a process known as hygroscopic growth) depending on the relative 
humidity and the composition of the aerosol. "Dry aerosol" means aerosol
without water. The specification of a physical process by the phrase 
due_to_process means that the quantity named is a single term in a sum 
of terms which together compose the general quantity named by omitting 
the phrase. "Wet deposition" means deposition by precipitation. 
"tendency_of_X" means derivative of X with respect to time. The chemical
formula for the sulfate anion is SO4(2-).

"tendency_of_X"
means derivative of X with respect to time. "Content" indicates a 
quantity per unit area. The "atmosphere content" of a quantity refers to
the vertical integral from the surface to the top of the atmosphere. 
For the content between specified levels in the atmosphere, standard 
names including "content_of_atmosphere_layer" are used. The mass is the 
total mass of the molecules. The specification of a physical process by 
the phrase "due_to_" process means that the quantity named is a single 
term in a sum of terms which together compose the general quantity named
by omitting the phrase. "Emission" means emission from a primary source
located anywhere within the atmosphere, including at the lower boundary
(i.e. earth's surface). "Emission" is a process entirely distinct from 
"re-emission" which is used in some standard names.  The chemical 
formula for toluene is C6H5CH3. Toluene has the same structure as 
benzene, except that one of the hydrogen atoms is replaced by a methyl 
group. The systematic name for toluene is methylbenzene. The "energy 
production and distribution" sector comprises fuel combustion activities
related to energy industries and fugitive emissions from fuels. It may 
also include any not-classified or "other" combustion, which is commonly
included in energy-related inventory data. "Energy production and 
distribution" is the term used in standard names to describe a 
collection of emission sources. A variable which has this value for the 
standard_name attribute should be accompanied by a comment attribute 
which lists the source categories and provides a reference to the 
categorization scheme, for example, "IPCC (Intergovernmental Panel on 
Climate Change) source categories 1A1 and 1B as defined in the 2006 IPCC
guidelines for national greenhouse gas inventories".

indicates a quantity per unit area.  The "atmosphere content" of a 
quantity refers to the vertical integral from the surface to the top of 
the atmosphere. For the content between specified levels in the 
atmosphere, standard names including content_of_atmosphere_layer are 
used.  "Aerosol" means the suspended liquid or solid particles in air 
(except cloud droplets).  The specification of a physical process by the
phrase due_to_process means that the quantity named is a  single term

Mass
fraction is used in the construction mass_fraction_of_X_in_Y, whereX is
a material constituent of Y. It means the ratio of the mass of X to the
mass of Y (including X).  A chemical species denoted by X may be 
described by a single term such as 'nitrogen' or a phrase such as 
'nox_expressed_as_nitrogen'. In an atmosphere model, stratiform cloud is
that produced by large-scale convergence (not the convection schemes). 
The specification of a physical process by the phrase due_to_process 
means that the quantity named is a   single term in a sum of terms which
together compose the general quantity  named by omitting the phrase.  
"tendency_of_X" means derivative of X with respect to time.  
Heterogeneous nucleation occurs when a small particle of a substance 
other than water acts as a freezing or condensation nucleus.

Practical Salinity is reported on the Practical Salinity Scale of 1978

tendency_of_sea_water_salinity_due_to_vertical_mixing
"tendency_of_X"
means derivative of X with respect to time. "Vertical mixing" means any
vertical transport other than by advection and bolus advection, 
represented by a combination of vertical diffusion, turbulent mixing and
convection in ocean models. The specification of a physical process by 
the phrase due_to_process means that the quantity named is a single term
in a sum of terms which together compose the general quantity named by 
omitting the phrase. Sea water salinity is the salt content of sea 
water, often on the Practical Salinity Scale of 1978. However, the 
unqualified term 'salinity' is generic and does not necessarily imply 
any particular method of calculation. The units of salinity are 
dimensionless and normally given as 1e-3 or 0.001 i.e. parts per 
thousand. There are standard names for the more precisely defined 
salinity quantities: sea_water_knudsen_salinity, S_K (used for salinity 
observations between 1901 and 1966), sea_water_cox_salinity, S_C (used 
for salinity observations between 1967 and 1977), 
sea_water_practical_salinity, S_P (used for salinity observations from 
1978 to the present day), sea_water_absolute_salinity, S_A, 
sea_water_preformed_salinity, S_*, and sea_water_reference_salinity. 
Practical Salinity is reported on the Practical Salinity Scale of 1978 
(PSS-78), and is usually based on the electrical conductivity of sea 
water in observations since the 1960s. Conversion of data between the 
observed scales follows: S_P = (S_K - 0.03) * (1.80655 / 1.805) and S_P =
S_C, however the accuracy of the latter is dependent on whether 
chlorinity or conductivity was used to determine the S_C value, with 
this inconsistency driving the development of PSS-78. The more precise 
standard names should be used where appropriate for both modelled and 
observed salinities. In particular, the use of sea_water_salinity to 
describe salinity observations made from 1978 onwards is now deprecated 
in favor of the term sea_water_practical_salinity which is the salinity 
quantity stored by national data centers for post-1978 observations. The
only exception to this is where the observed salinities are definitely 
known not to be recorded on the Practical Salinity Scale. The unit 
"parts per thousand" was used for sea_water_knudsen_salinity and 
sea_water_cox_salinity.

tendency_of_sea_water_temperature
"tendency_of_X"
means derivative of X with respect to time. Sea water temperature is 
the in situ temperature of the sea water. For observed data, depending 
on the period during which the observation was made, the measured in 
situ temperature was recorded against standard "scales". These 
historical scales include the International Practical Temperature Scale 
of 1948 (IPTS-48; 1948-1967), the International Practical Temperature

Temperature Scale of 1990 (ITS-90, Saunders 1990; 1990 onwards). 
Conversion of data between these scales follows t68 = t48 - (4.4 x 
10e-6) * t48(100 - t - 48); t90 = 0.99976 * t68. Observations made prior
to 1948 (IPTS-48) have not been documented and therefore a conversion 
cannot be certain. Differences between t90 and t68 can be up to 0.01 at 
temperatures of 40 C and above; differences of 0.002-0.007 occur across 
the standard range of ocean temperatures (-10 - 30 C). The International
Equation of State of Seawater 1980 (EOS-80, UNESCO, 1981) and the 
Practical Salinity Scale (PSS-78) were both based on IPTS-68, while the 
Thermodynamic Equation of Seawater 2010 (TEOS-10) is based on ITS-90.

Upwelling
radiation is radiation from below. It does not mean "net upward".  When
thought of as being incident on a surface, a radiative flux is 
sometimes called "irradiance".  In addition, it is identical with the 
quantity measured by a cosine-collector light-meter and sometimes called
"vector irradiance".  In accordance with common usage in geophysical 
disciplines, "flux" implies per unit area, called "flux density" in 
physics.  A phrase assuming_condition  indicates that the named quantity
is the value which would obtain if all  aspects of the system were 
unaltered except for the assumption of the  circumstances specified by 
the condition.  "shortwave" means shortwave radiation.

which it is going must be specified, for instance with a coordinate of 
zenith_angle. If the radiation does not depend on direction, a standard
