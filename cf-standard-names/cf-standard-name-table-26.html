A note about units
</b>
<br>
The canonical units associated with each standard name are usually the SI units for the quantity.
<span class="link-external">
<a href="http://cf-convention.github.io/1.6.html#standard-name">
Section 3.3 of the CF conventions
</a>
</span>
states: "Unless it is dimensionless, a variable with a standard_name 
attribute must have units which are physically equivalent (not 
necessarily identical) to the canonical units, possibly modified by an 
operation specified by either the standard name modifier ... or by the 
cell_methods attribute." Furthermore, 
<span class="link-external">
<a href="http://cf-convention.github.io/1.6.html#idp4625472">
Section 1.3 of the CF conventions
</a>
</span>
states: "The values of the units attributes are character strings that 
are recognized by UNIDATA's Udunits package [UDUNITS], (with exceptions 
allowed as discussed in Section 3.1, “Units”)." For example, a variable 
with the standard name of "air_temperature" may have a units attribute 
of "degree_Celsius" because Celsius can be converted to Kelvin by 
Udunits. For the full range of supported units, refer to the 
<span class="link-external">
<a href="http://www.unidata.ucar.edu/software/udunits/udunits-2-units.html">
Udunits documentation

</span>
. Refer to the

for full details of the units attribute.

Global
average sea level change is due to change in volume of the water in the
ocean, caused by mass and/or density change, or to change in the volume
of the ocean basins, caused by tectonics etc. It is sometimes called 
"eustatic", which is a term that also has other definitions. It differs 
from the change in the global average sea surface height relative to the
centre of the Earth by the global average vertical movement of the 
ocean floor. Zero sea level change is an arbitrary level. Amplitude is 
the magnitude of a wave modelled by a sinusoidal function. A coordinate 
variable of harmonic_period can be used to specify the period of the 
sinusoidal wave.

azimuth angle. Solar azimuth angle is the horizontal angle between the 
line of sight from the observation point to the sun and a reference 
direction at the observation point, which is often due north. The angle 
is measured clockwise, starting from the reference direction. Platform 
azimuth angle is the horizontal angle between the line of sight from the

through hygroscopic growth. The extent of hygroscopic growth depends on
the relative humidity and the composition of the aerosol. The "Angstrom
exponent" appears in the formula relating aerosol optical thickness to 
the wavelength of incident radiation: T(lambda) = T(lambda0) * 
[lambda/lambda0] ** (-1 * alpha) where alpha is the Angstrom exponent, 
lambda is the wavelength of incident radiation, lambda0 is a reference 
wavelength, T(lambda) and T(lambda0) are the values of aerosol optical

In
accordance with common usage in geophysical disciplines, "flux" implies
per unit area, called "flux density" in physics.  The atmosphere 
convective mass flux is the vertical transport of mass for a field of 
cumulus clouds or thermals, given by the product of air density and 
vertical velocity. For an area-average, cell_methods should specify 
whether the average is over all the area or the area of updrafts and/or 
downdrafts only.  "Downdraft" means that the flux is positive in the 
downward direction (negative upward).

names for all species belonging to the family that are represented 
within a given model. The list of individual species that are included 
in a quantity with a group chemical standard name can vary between 
models.  Where possible, the data variable should be accompanied by a 
complete description of the species represented, for example, by using a
comment attribute. "Inorganic chlorine", sometimes referred to as Cly, 
describes a family of chemical species which result from the degradation
of source gases containing chlorine (CFCs, HCFCs, VSLS) and natural 
inorganic chlorine sources such as seasalt and other aerosols.   
Standard names that use the term "inorganic_chlorine" are used for 
quantities that contain all inorganic chlorine species including HCl and
ClONO2. The phrase 'expressed_as' is used in the construction 
A_expressed_as_B, where B is a chemical constituent of A. It means that 
the quantity indicated by the standard name is calculated solely with 
respect to the B contained in A, neglecting all other chemical 
constituents of A.

X in the entire atmosphere, i.e. summed over the atmospheric column and
over the entire globe. "Clox" describes a family of chemical species 
consisting of inorganic chlorine compounds with the exception of  
hydrogen chloride (HCl) and chlorine nitrate (ClONO2). "Clox" is the 
term used in standard names for all species belonging to the family that
are represented within a given model. The list of individual species 
that are included in a quantity with a group chemical standard name can 
vary between models.  Where possible, the data variable should be 
accompanied by a complete description of the species represented, for 
example, by using a comment attribute. "Inorganic chlorine", sometimes 
referred to as Cly, describes a family of chemical species which result 
from the degradation of source gases containing chlorine (CFCs, HCFCs, 
VSLS) and natural inorganic chlorine sources such as seasalt and other 
aerosols.   Standard names that use the term "inorganic_chlorine" are 
used for quantities that contain all inorganic chlorine species 
including HCl and ClONO2. The phrase 'expressed_as' is used in the 
construction A_expressed_as_B, where B is a chemical constituent of A. 
It means that the quantity indicated by the standard name is calculated 
solely with respect to the B contained in A, neglecting all other 
chemical constituents of A.

even when the sample is not of Reference Composition. In practice, 
Absolute Salinity is often calculated from Practical Salinity using a 
spatial lookup table of pre-defined values of the Absolute Salinity 
Anomaly. It is recommended that the version of (TEOS-10) software and 
the associated Absolute Salinity Anomaly climatology be specified within
metadata by attaching a comment attribute to the data variable.

means change in a quantity X over a time-interval, which should be

is defined on the Practical Salinity Scale of 1978 (PSS-78) and is 
calculated from the electrical conductivity of sea water (as well as 
temperature and pressure).  Officially S_P is dimensionless so that, 
while convenient, and while it is common practice, it is not officially 
sanctioned to say S_P = 35 psu. Often authors use PSS-78, as in S_P = 35
PSS-78. If salinity was measured using remote sensing techniques and 
not conductivity, then it is recommended that additional metadata 
(calibration/validation information) be described in the variable 
comment attribute. This name should be used to describe salinity 
observations made from 1978 onwards (Practical Salinity is the salinity 
quantity stored by national data centres for post-1978 observations). 
The only exception to this is where the observed salinities are 
definitely known not to be recorded on the Practical Salinity Scale.  
There are also standard names for the precisely defined salinity 
quantities sea_water_knudsen_salinity, S_K (used for salinity 
observations between 1901 and 1966), sea_water_cox_salinity, S_C (used

variable that is designed to be as conservative as possible, by removing

"change_over_time_in_X"
means change in a quantity X over a time-interval, which should be 
defined by the bounds of the time coordinate. Sea water salinity is the 
salt content of sea water, often on the Practical Salinity Scale of 
1978. However, the unqualified term 'salinity' is generic and does not 
necessarily imply any particular method of calculation. The units of 
salinity are dimensionless and the units attribute should normally be 
given as 1e-3 or 0.001 i.e. parts per thousand. There are standard names
for the more precisely defined salinity quantities: 
sea_water_knudsen_salinity, S_K (used for salinity observations between 
1901 and 1966), sea_water_cox_salinity, S_C (used for salinity 
observations between 1967 and 1977), sea_water_practical_salinity, S_P 
(used for salinity observations from 1978 to the present day), 
sea_water_absolute_salinity, S_A, sea_water_preformed_salinity, S_*, and
sea_water_reference_salinity. Practical Salinity is reported on the 
Practical Salinity Scale of 1978 (PSS-78), and is usually based on the 
electrical conductivity of sea water in observations since the 1960s. 
Conversion of data between the observed scales follows: S_P = (S_K - 
0.03) * (1.80655 / 1.805) and S_P = S_C, however the accuracy of the 
latter is dependent on whether chlorinity or conductivity was used to 
determine the S_C value, with this inconsistency driving the development
of PSS-78. The more precise standard names should be used where 
appropriate for both modelled and observed salinities. In particular, 
the use of sea_water_salinity to describe salinity observations made 
from 1978 onwards is now deprecated in favor of the term 
sea_water_practical_salinity which is the salinity quantity stored by 
national data centers for post-1978 observations. The only exception to 
this is where the observed salinities are definitely known not to be 
recorded on the Practical Salinity Scale. The unit "parts per thousand" 
was used for sea_water_knudsen_salinity and sea_water_cox_salinity.

"change_over_time_in_X"
means change in a quantity X over a time-interval, which should be 
defined by the bounds of the time coordinate.Sea water temperature is 
the in situ temperature of the sea water. To specify the depth at which 
the temperature applies use a vertical coordinate variable or scalar 
coordinate variable. There are standard names for 
sea_surface_temperature, sea_surface_skin_temperature, 
sea_surface_subskin_temperature and sea_surface_foundation_temperature 
which can be used to describe data located at the specified surfaces. 
For observed data, depending on the period during which the observation 
was made, the measured in situ temperature was recorded against standard
"scales". These historical scales include the International Practical 
Temperature Scale of 1948 (IPTS-48; 1948-1967), the International 
Practical Temperature Scale of 1968 (IPTS-68, Barber, 1969; 1968-1989) 
and the International Temperature Scale of 1990 (ITS-90, Saunders 1990; 
1990 onwards). Conversion of data between these scales follows t68 = t48
- (4.4 x 10e-6) * t48(100 - t - 48); t90 = 0.99976 * t68. Observations 
made prior to 1948 (IPTS-48) have not been documented and therefore a 
conversion cannot be certain. Differences between t90 and t68 can be up 
to 0.01 at temperatures of 40 C and above; differences of 0.002-0.007 
occur across the standard range of ocean temperatures (-10 - 30 C). The 
International Equation of State of Seawater 1980 (EOS-80, UNESCO, 1981) 
and the Practical Salinity Scale (PSS-78) were both based on IPTS-68, 
while the Thermodynamic Equation of Seawater 2010 (TEOS-10) is based on 
ITS-90. References: Barber, 1969, doi: 10.1088/0026-1394/5/2/001;

"direction_of_X"
means direction of a  vector, a bearing.  "Displacement" means the 
change in geospatial position of an object that has moved over time. If 
possible, the time interval over which the motion took place should be 
specified using a bounds variable for the time coordinate variable.  A 
displacement can be represented as a vector. Such a vector should 
however not be interpreted as describing a rectilinear, constant speed 
motion but merely as an indication that the start point of the vector is
found at the tip of the vector after the time interval associated with 
the displacement variable.  A displacement does not prescribe a 
trajectory. Sea ice displacement can be defined as a two-dimensional 
vector, with no vertical component. In that case, "displacement" is also
the distance across the earth's surface calculated from the change in a
moving object's geospatial position between the start and end of the

that the quantity named is a single term in a sum of terms which 
together compose the general quantity named by omitting the phrase. 
"Downward" indicates a vector component which is positive when directed 
downward (negative upward). Dry static energy is the sum of enthalpy and
potential energy (itself the sum of gravitational and centripetal 
potential energy). Enthalpy can be written either as (1) CpT, where Cp 
is heat capacity at constant pressure, T is absolute temperature, or (2)
U+pV, where U is internal energy, p is pressure and V is volume. In

"Eastward"
indicates a vector component which is positive when directed eastward 
(negative westward).  "Displacement" means the change in geospatial 
position of an object that has moved over time. If possible, the time 
interval over which the motion took place should be specified using a 
bounds variable for the time coordinate variable.  A displacement can be
represented as a vector. Such a vector should however not be 
interpreted as describing a rectilinear, constant speed motion but 
merely as an indication that the start point of the vector is found at 
the tip of the vector after the time interval associated with the 
displacement variable.  A displacement does not prescribe a trajectory. 
Sea ice displacement can be defined as a two-dimensional vector, with no
vertical component. An eastward displacement is the distance calculated
from the change in a moving object's longitude between the start and 
end of the time interval associated with the displacement variable.

the sea water. For observed data, depending on the period during which 
the observation was made, the measured in situ temperature was recorded 
against standard "scales". These historical scales include the 
International Practical Temperature Scale of 1948 (IPTS-48; 1948-1967), 
the International Practical Temperature Scale of 1968 (IPTS-68, Barber, 
1969; 1968-1989) and the International Temperature Scale of 1990 
(ITS-90, Saunders 1990; 1990 onwards). Conversion of data between these 
scales follows t68 = t48 - (4.4 x 10e-6) * t48(100 - t - 48); t90 = 
0.99976 * t68. Observations made prior to 1948 (IPTS-48) have not been 
documented and therefore a conversion cannot be certain. Differences 
between t90 and t68 can be up to 0.01 at temperatures of 40 C and above;
differences of 0.002-0.007 occur across the standard range of ocean 
temperatures (-10 - 30 C). The International Equation of State of 
Seawater 1980 (EOS-80, UNESCO, 1981) and the Practical Salinity Scale 
(PSS-78) were both based on IPTS-68, while the Thermodynamic Equation of
Seawater 2010 (TEOS-10) is based on ITS-90. References: Barber, 1969,

"tendency_of_X"
means derivative of X with respect to time. The Lagrangian tendency of a
quantity is its rate of change following the motion of the fluid, also 
called the "material derivative" or "convective derivative". The 
Lagrangian tendency of air pressure, often called "omega", plays the 
role of the upward component of air velocity when air pressure is being 
used as the vertical coordinate. If the vertical air velocity is 
upwards, it is negative when expressed as a tendency of air pressure; 
downwards is positive.

"magnitude_of_X"
means magnitude of a vector X.   'Displacement' means the change in 
geospatial position of an object that has moved over time. If possible, 
the time interval over which the motion took place should be specified 
using a bounds variable for the time coordinate variable.  A 
displacement can be represented as a vector. Such a vector should 
however not be interpreted as describing a rectilinear, constant speed 
motion but merely as an indication that the start point of the vector is
found at the tip of the vector after the time interval associated with 
the displacement variable.  A displacement does not prescribe a 
trajectory. Sea ice displacement can be defined as a two-dimensional 
vector, with no vertical component.

chlorophyll that occur naturally. All contain a chlorin ring (chemical 
formula C20H16N4) which gives the green pigment and a side chain whose 
structure varies. The naturally occurring forms of chlorophyll contain 
between 35 and 55 carbon atoms. 'Calcareous phytoplankton' are 
phytoplankton that produce calcite. Calcite is a mineral that is a 
polymorph of calcium carbonate. The chemical formula of calcite is 
CaCO3. Phytoplankton are autotrophic prokaryotic or eukaryotic algae 
that live near the water surface where there is sufficient light to

are represented within a given model. The list of individual species 
that are included in a quantity with a group chemical standard name can 
vary between models.  Where possible, the data variable should be 
accompanied by a complete description of the species represented, for 
example, by using a comment attribute. "Inorganic chlorine", sometimes 
referred to as Cly, describes a family of chemical species which result 
from the degradation of source gases containing chlorine (CFCs, HCFCs, 
VSLS) and natural inorganic chlorine sources such as seasalt and other 
aerosols.   Standard names that use the term "inorganic_chlorine" are 
used for quantities that contain all inorganic chlorine species 
including HCl and ClONO2. The phrase 'expressed_as' is used in the 
construction A_expressed_as_B, where B is a chemical constituent of A.

'Mass
concentration' means mass per unit volume and is used in the 
construction mass_concentration_of_X_in_Y, where X is a material 
constituent of Y.  A chemical or biological species denoted by X may be 
described by a single term such as 'nitrogen' or a phrase such as 
'nox_expressed_as_nitrogen'. The phrase 'expressed_as' is used in the 
construction A_expressed_as_B, where B is a chemical constituent of A. 
It means that the quantity indicated by the standard name is calculated 
solely with respect to the B contained in A, neglecting all other 
chemical constituents of A. 'Flagellates' are a class of single celled 
organisms that use a flagellum (whip-like structure) for feeding and 
locomotion. Some flagellates can photosynthesize and others feed on 
bacteria, with a few flagellatescapable of both.

most plants, algae and cyanobacteria; their presence is essential for 
photosynthesis to take place. There are several different forms of 
chlorophyll that occur naturally. All contain a chlorin ring (chemical 
formula C20H16N4) which gives the green pigment and a side chain whose 
structure varies. The naturally occurring forms of chlorophyll contain 
between 35 and 55 carbon atoms. 'Miscellaneous phytoplankton' are all 
those phytoplankton that are not diatoms, diazotrophs, calcareous 
phytoplankton, picophytoplankton or other seperately named components of
the phytoplankton population. Phytoplankton are autotrophic prokaryotic
or eukaryotic algae that live near the water surface where there is 
sufficient light to support photosynthesis.

Mass
concentration means mass per unit volume and is used in the

described by a single term such as "nitrogen" or a phrase such as 
"nox_expressed_as_nitrogen". The phrase "expressed_as" is used in the 
construction A_expressed_as_B, where B is a chemical constituent of A. 
It means that the quantity indicated by the standard name is calculated 
solely with respect to the B contained in A, neglecting all other 
chemical constituents of A. Phytoplankton are autotrophic prokaryotic or
eukaryotic algae that live near the water surface where there is 
sufficient light to support photosynthesis. Standard names also exist 
for the mass concentration of a number of components that make up the 
total phytoplankton population, such as diatoms, diazotrophs, calcareous
phytoplankton, picophytoplankton and miscellaneous phytoplankton. 
Chlorophylls are the green pigments found in most plants, algae and 
cyanobacteria; their presence is essential for photosynthesis to take 
place. There are several different forms of chlorophyll that occur 
naturally. All contain a chlorin ring (chemical formula C20H16N4) which 
gives the green pigment and a side chain whose structure varies. The 
naturally occurring forms of chlorophyll contain between 35 and 55 
carbon atoms.

Mass
fraction is used in the construction mass_fraction_of_X_in_Y, whereX is
a material constituent of Y. It means the ratio of the mass of X to the
mass of Y (including X).  A chemical species denoted by X may be 
described by a single term such as 'nitrogen' or a phrase such as 
'nox_expressed_as_nitrogen'. The term "peroxy_radicals" means all 
organic and inorganic peroxy radicals. This includes HO2 and all organic
peroxyradicals, sometimes referred to as RO2. In chemistry, a 'radical'
is a highly reactive, and therefore shortlived, species.

mass of Y (including X).  A chemical species denoted by X may be 
described by a single term such as 'nitrogen' or a phrase such as 
'nox_expressed_as_nitrogen'. "Noy" describes a family of chemical 
species. The family usually includes atomic nitrogen (N), nitrogen 
monoxide (NO), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), dinitrogen pentoxide (N2O5), 
nitric acid (HNO3), peroxynitric acid (HNO4), bromine nitrate (BrONO2) ,
chlorine nitrate (ClONO2) and organic nitrates (most notably 
peroxyacetyl nitrate, sometimes referred to as PAN, (CH3COO2NO2)). The 
list of individual species that are included in a quantity having a 
group chemical standard name can vary between models.  Where possible, 
the data variable should be accompanied by a complete description of the
species represented, for example, by using a comment attribute. The 
phrase 'expressed_as' is used in the construction A_expressed_as_B, 
where B is a chemical constituent of A. It means that the quantity 
indicated by the standard name is calculated solely with respect to the B
contained in A, neglecting all other chemical constituents of A.

a material constituent of Y. It means the ratio of the mass of X to the
mass of Y (including X).  A chemical species denoted by X may be 
described by a single term such as 'nitrogen' or a phrase such as 
'nox_expressed_as_nitrogen'. Terpenes are hydrocarbons, that is,they 
contain only hydrogen and carbon combined in the general proportions 
(C5H8)n where n is an integer greater than on equal to one. The term 
"terpenes" is used in standard names to describe the group of chemical 
species having this common structure that are represented within a given
model. The list of individual species that are included in a quantity 
having a group chemical standard name can vary between models.  Where 
possible, the data variable should be accompanied by a complete 
description of the species represented, for example, by using a comment 
attribute.  Standard names exist for some individual terpene species, 
e.g., isoprene and limonene.

is the organic matter present in soil quantified by the mass of carbon 
it contains. Soil carbon is returned to the atmosphere as the organic 
matter decays. The decay process takes varying amounts of time depending
on the composition of the organic matter, the temperature and the 
availability of moisture. A carbon "soil pool" means the carbon 
contained in organic matter which has a characteristic period over which
it decays and releases carbon into the atmosphere. "Medium soil pool" 
refers to the decay of organic matter in soil with a characteristic 
period of between ten and one hundred years under reference climate

model. The list of individual species that are included in a quantity 
with a group chemical standard name can vary between models.  Where 
possible, the data variable should be accompanied by a complete 
description of the species represented, for example, byusing a comment 
attribute. "Inorganic chlorine", sometimes referred to as Cly, describes
a family of chemical species which result from the degradation of 
source gases containing chlorine (CFCs, HCFCs, VSLS) and natural 
inorganic chlorine sources such as seasaltand other aerosols.   Standard
names that use the term "inorganic_chlorine" are used for quantities 
that contain all inorganic chlorine species including HCl and ClONO2. 
The phrase 'expressed_as' is used in the construction A_expressed_as_B, 
where B is a chemical constituent of A. It means that the quantity 
indicated by the standard name is calculatedsolely with respect to the B
contained in A, neglecting all other chemical constituents ofA.

'nitrogen' or a phrase such as 'nox_expressed_as_nitrogen'. "Noy" 
describes a family of chemical species. The family usually includes 
atomic nitrogen (N), nitrogen monoxide (NO), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), 
dinitrogen pentoxide (N2O5), nitric acid (HNO3), peroxynitric acid 
(HNO4), bromine nitrate (BrONO2) , chlorine nitrate (ClONO2) and organic
nitrates (most notably peroxyacetyl nitrate, sometimes referred to as 
PAN, (CH3COO2NO2)). The list of individual species that are included in a
quantity having a group chemical standard name can vary between models.
Where possible, the data variable should be accompanied by a complete 
description of the species represented, for example, by using a comment 
attribute. The phrase 'expressed_as' is used in the construction 
A_expressed_as_B, where B is a chemical constituent of A. It means that 
the quantity indicated by the standard name iscalculated solely with 
respect to the B contained in A, neglecting all other chemical 
constituents of A.

"Content"
indicates a quantity per unit area. The 
"content_of_X_in_atmosphere_layer" refers to the vertical integral 
between two specified levels in the atmosphere. "Layer" means any layer 
with upper and lower boundaries that have constant values in some 
vertical coordinate. There must be a vertical coordinate variable 
indicating the extent of the layer(s). If the layers are model layers, 
the vertical coordinate can be model_level_number, but it is recommended
to specify a physical coordinate (in a scalar or auxiliary coordinate 
variable) as well. For the mole content integrated from the surface to 
the top of the atmosphere, standard names including 
"atmosphere_mole_content_of_X" are used. The chemical formula for ozone 
is O3. "mole_content_of_ozone_in_atmosphere_layer" is usually measured 
in Dobson Units which are equivalent to 446.2 micromoles m-2. N.B. Data 
variables containing column content of ozone can be given the standard 
name of either equivalent_thickness_at_stp_of_atmosphere_ozone_content 
or atmosphere_mole_content_of_ozone. The latter name is recommended for 
consistency with mole content names for chemical species other than 
ozone.

a material constituent of Y.  A chemical species denoted by X may be 
described by a single term such as 'nitrogen' or a phrase such as 
'nox_expressed_as_nitrogen'. "Clox" describes a family of chemical 
species consisting of inorganic chlorine compounds withthe exception of 
hydrogen chloride (HCl) and chlorine nitrate (ClONO2). "Clox" is the 
term used in standard names for all species belonging to the family that
are represented within a given model. The list of individual species 
that are included in a quantity with a group chemical standard name can 
vary between models.  Where possible, the data variable should be 
accompanied by a complete description of the species represented, for 
example, by using a comment attribute. "Inorganic chlorine", sometimes 
referred to as Cly, describes a family of chemical species which result 
from the degradation of source gasescontaining chlorine (CFCs, HCFCs, 
VSLS) and natural inorganic chlorine sources such as seasalt and other 
aerosols.   Standard names that use the term "inorganic_chlorine" are 
used for quantities that contain all inorganic chlorine species 
including HCl and ClONO2. The phrase 'expressed_as' is used in the 
construction A_expressed_as_B, where B is a chemical constituent of A. 
It means that the quantity indicated by the standard name is calculated 
solely with respect to the B contained in A, neglecting all other 
chemical constituents of A.

"Normalized_difference_vegetation_index",
usually abbreviated to NDVI, is an index calculated from reflectances 
measured in the visible and near infrared channels.  It is calculated as
NDVI = (NIR - R) / (NIR + R) where NIR is the reflectance in the 
near-infrared band and R is the reflectance in the red visible band.  
Reflectance is the ratio of the reflected over the incoming radiation in
each spectral band.  The calculated value of NDVI depends on the 
precise definitions of the spectral bands and these definitions may vary
between different models and remote sensing instruments.

"Northward"
indicates a vector component which is positive when directed northward 
(negative southward).  "Displacement" means the change in geospatial 
position of an object that has moved over time. If possible, the time 
interval over which the motion took place should be specified using a 
bounds variable for the time coordinate variable.  A displacement can be
represented as a vector. Such a vector should however not be 
interpreted as describing a rectilinear, constant speed motion but 
merely as an indication that the start point of the vector is found at 
the tip of the vector after the time interval associated with the 
displacement variable.  A displacement does not prescribe a trajectory. 
Sea ice displacement can be defined as a two-dimensional vector, with no
vertical component. A northward displacement is the distance calculated
from the change in a moving object's latitude between the start and end
of the time interval associated with the displacement variable.

"integral_of_Y_wrt_X"
means int Y dX. The data variable should have an axis for X specifying 
the limits of the integral as bounds. "wrt" means with respect to. Depth
is the vertical distance below the surface. Sea water temperature is 
the in situ temperature of the sea water. For observed data, depending 
on the period during which the observation was made, the measured in 
situ temperature was recorded against standard "scales". These 
historical scales include the International Practical Temperature Scale 
of 1948 (IPTS-48; 1948-1967), the International Practical Temperature 
Scale of 1968 (IPTS-68, Barber, 1969; 1968-1989) and the International 
Temperature Scale of 1990 (ITS-90, Saunders 1990; 1990 onwards). 
Conversion of data between these scales follows t68 = t48 - (4.4 x 
10e-6) * t48(100 - t - 48); t90 = 0.99976 * t68. Observations made prior
to 1948 (IPTS-48) have not been documented and therefore a conversion 
cannot be certain. Differences between t90 and t68 can be up to 0.01 at 
temperatures of 40 C and above; differences of 0.002-0.007 occur across 
the standard range of ocean temperatures (-10 - 30 C). The International
Equation of State of Seawater 1980 (EOS-80, UNESCO, 1981) and the 
Practical Salinity Scale (PSS-78) were both based on IPTS-68, while the 
Thermodynamic Equation of Seawater 2010 (TEOS-10) is based on ITS-90.

"Layer"
means any layer with upper and lower boundaries that have constant 
values in some vertical coordinate. There must be a vertical coordinate 
variable indicating the extent of the layer(s). If the layers are model 
layers, the vertical coordinate can be model_level_number, but it is 
recommended to specify a physical coordinate (in a scalar or auxiliary 
coordinate variable) as well.  The optical thickness is the integral 
along the path of radiation of a volume 
scattering/absorption/attenuation coefficient. The radiative flux is 
reduced by a factor exp(-optical_thickness) on traversing the path.  A 
coordinate variable of radiation_wavelength or radiation_frequency can 
be specified to indicate that the optical thickness applies at specific 
wavelengths or frequencies. "Aerosol" means the suspended liquid or 
solid particles in air (except cloud droplets).  "Ambient aerosol" is 
aerosol that has taken up ambient water through hygroscopic growth. The 
extent of hygroscopic growth depends on the relative humidity and the 
composition of the aerosol. The specification of a physical process by 
the phrase due_to_process means that the quantity named is a  single

Global
average sea level change is due to change in volume of the water in the
ocean, caused by mass and/or density change, or to change in the volume
of the ocean basins, caused by tectonics etc. It is sometimes called 
"eustatic", which is a term that also has other definitions. It differs 
from the change in the global average sea surface height relative to the
centre of the Earth by the global average vertical movement of the 
ocean floor. Zero sea level change is an arbitrary level. Phase is the 
initial angle of a wave modelled by a sinusoidal function. A coordinate 
variable of harmonic_period can be used to specify the period of the 
sinusoidal wave.

"Respiration
carbon" refers to the rate at which biomass is respired expressed as 
the mass of carbon which it contains. Plant respiration is the sum of 
respiration by parts of plants both above and below the soil. Plants 
which photosynthesise are autotrophs i.e. "producers" of the biomass 
which they respire from inorganic precursors using sunlight for energy. 
In accordance with common usage in geophysical disciplines, "flux" 
implies per unit area, called "flux density" in physics.

Platform azimuth angle is the horizontal angle between the line of sight

the observation point, which is often due north. The angle is measured 
clockwise positive, starting from the reference direction. A comment 
attribute should be added to a data variable with the standard name

measured starting from directly overhead and its range is from zero 
(directly overhead the observation target) to 180 degrees (directly

"product_of_X_and_Y"
means X*Y. A velocity is a vector quantity. "Eastward" indicates a 
vector component which is positive when directed eastward (negative 
westward). Sea water salinity is the salt content of sea water, often on
the Practical Salinity Scale of 1978. However, the unqualified term 
'salinity' is generic and does not necessarily imply any particular 
method of calculation. The units of salinity are dimensionless and 
normally given as 1e-3 or 0.001 i.e. parts per thousand. There are 
standard names for the more precisely defined salinity quantities: 
sea_water_knudsen_salinity, S_K (used for salinity observations between 
1901 and 1966), sea_water_cox_salinity, S_C (used for salinity 
observations between 1967 and 1977), sea_water_practical_salinity, S_P 
(used for salinity observations from 1978 to the present day), 
sea_water_absolute_salinity, S_A, sea_water_preformed_salinity, S_*, and
sea_water_reference_salinity. Practical Salinity is reported on the 
Practical Salinity Scale of 1978 (PSS-78), and is usually based on the 
electrical conductivity of sea water in observations since the 1960s. 
Conversion of data between the observed scales follows: S_P = (S_K - 
0.03) * (1.80655 / 1.805) and S_P = S_C, however the accuracy of the 
latter is dependent on whether chlorinity or conductivity was used to 
determine the S_C value, with this inconsistency driving the development
of PSS-78. The more precise standard names should be used where 
appropriate for both modelled and observed salinities. In particular, 
the use of sea_water_salinity to describe salinity observations made 
from 1978 onwards is now deprecated in favor of the term 
sea_water_practical_salinity which is the salinity quantity stored by 
national data centers for post-1978 observations. The only exception to 
this is where the observed salinities are definitely known not to be 
recorded on the Practical Salinity Scale. The unit "parts per thousand" 
was used for sea_water_knudsen_salinity and sea_water_cox_salinity.

"product_of_X_and_Y"
means X*Y. A velocity is a vector quantity. "Northward" indicates a 
vector component which is positive when directed northward (negative 
southward). Sea water salinity is the salt content of sea water, often 
on the Practical Salinity Scale of 1978. However, the unqualified term 
'salinity' is generic and does not necessarily imply any particular 
method of calculation. The units of salinity are dimensionless and 
normally given as 1e-3 or 0.001 i.e. parts per thousand. There are 
standard names for the more precisely defined salinity quantities: 
sea_water_knudsen_salinity, S_K (used for salinity observations between 
1901 and 1966), sea_water_cox_salinity, S_C (used for salinity 
observations between 1967 and 1977), sea_water_practical_salinity, S_P 
(used for salinity observations from 1978 to the present day), 
sea_water_absolute_salinity, S_A, sea_water_preformed_salinity, S_*, and
sea_water_reference_salinity. Practical Salinity is reported on the 
Practical Salinity Scale of 1978 (PSS-78), and is usually based on the 
electrical conductivity of sea water in observations since the 1960s. 
Conversion of data between the observed scales follows: S_P = (S_K - 
0.03) * (1.80655 / 1.805) and S_P = S_C, however the accuracy of the 
latter is dependent on whether chlorinity or conductivity was used to 
determine the S_C value, with this inconsistency driving the development
of PSS-78. The more precise standard names should be used where 
appropriate for both modelled and observed salinities. In particular, 
the use of sea_water_salinity to describe salinity observations made 
from 1978 onwards is now deprecated in favor of the term 
sea_water_practical_salinity which is the salinity quantity stored by 
national data centers for post-1978 observations. The only exception to 
this is where the observed salinities are definitely known not to be 
recorded on the Practical Salinity Scale. The unit "parts per thousand" 
was used for sea_water_knudsen_salinity and sea_water_cox_salinity.

The
surface called "surface" means the lower boundary of the atmosphere. 
The sea surface foundation temperature is the water temperature that is 
not influenced by a thermally stratified layer of diurnal temperature 
variability (either by daytime warming or nocturnal cooling). The 
foundation temperature is named to indicate that it is the temperature 
from which the growth of the diurnal thermocline develops each day, 
noting that on some occasions with a deep mixed layer there is no clear 
foundation temperature in the surface layer. In general, sea surface 
foundation temperature will be similar to a night time minimum or 
pre-dawn value at depths of between approximately 1 and 5 meters. In the
absence of any diurnal signal, the foundation temperature is considered
equivalent to the quantity with standard name 
sea_surface_subskin_temperature. The sea surface foundation temperature 
defines a level in the upper water column that varies in depth, space, 
and time depending on the local balance between thermal stratification 
and turbulent energy and is expected to change slowly over the course of
a day. If possible, a data variable with the standard name 
sea_surface_foundation_temperature should be used with a scalar vertical
coordinate variable to specify the depth of the foundation level. Sea 
surface foundation temperature is measured at the base of the diurnal 
thermocline or as close to the water surface as possible in the absence 
of thermal stratification. Only in situ contact thermometry is able to 
measure the sea surface foundation temperature. Analysis procedures must
be used to estimate sea surface foundation temperature value from 
radiometric satellite measurements of the quantities with standard names
sea_surface_skin_temperature and sea_surface_subskin_temperature.  Sea 
surface foundation temperature provides a connection with the historical
concept of a "bulk" sea surface temperature considered representative 
of the oceanic mixed layer temperature that is typically represented by 
any sea temperature measurement within the upper ocean over a depth 
range of 1 to approximately 20 meters. The general term, "bulk" sea 
surface temperature, has the standard name sea_surface_temperature with 
no associated vertical coordinate axis. Sea surface foundation 
temperature provides a more precise, well-defined quantity than "bulk" 
sea surface temperature and, consequently, is more representative of the
mixed layer temperature.  The temperature of sea water at a particular 
depth (other than the foundation level) should be reported using the 
standard name sea_water_temperature and, wherever possible, supplying a 
vertical coordinate axis or scalar coordinate variable.

The
geoid is a surface of constant geopotential with which mean sea level 
would coincide if the ocean were at rest. (The volume enclosed between 
the geoid and the sea floor equals the mean volume of water in the 
ocean.) In an ocean GCM the geoid is the surface of zero depth, or the 
rigid lid if the model uses that approximation. "Sea surface height" is a
time-varying quantity. By definition of the geoid, the global average 
of the time-mean sea surface height (i.e. mean sea level) above the 
geoid must be zero. The standard name for the height of the sea surface 
above mean sea level is sea_surface_height_above_sea_level. The standard

sea_surface_height_above_reference_ellipsoid.

<div id="sea_surface_salinity_help" style="display: none; padding-left: 16px; margin-top: 4px; border-top: 1px dashed #cccccc;">
Sea
surface salinity is the salt content of sea water close to the sea 
surface, often on the Practical Salinity Scale of 1978. However, the 
unqualified term 'salinity' is generic and does not necessarily imply 
any particular method of calculation. The units of salinity are 
dimensionless and the units attribute should normally be given as 1e-3 
or 0.001 i.e. parts per thousand. Sea surface salinity is often 
abbreviated as "SSS". For the salinity of sea water at a particular 
depth or layer, a data variable of "sea_water_salinity" or one of the 
more precisely defined salinities should be used with a vertical 
coordinate axis. There are standard names for the precisely defined 
salinity quantities: sea_water_knudsen_salinity, S_K (used for salinity 
observations between 1901 and 1966), sea_water_cox_salinity, S_C (used 
for salinity observations between 1967 and 1977), 
sea_water_practical_salinity, S_P (used for salinity observations from 
1978 to the present day), sea_water_absolute_salinity, S_A, 
sea_water_preformed_salinity, S_*, and sea_water_reference_salinity. 
Practical Salinity is reported on the Practical Salinity Scale of 1978 
(PSS-78), and is usually based on the electrical conductivity of sea 
water in observations since the 1960s. Conversion of data between the 
observed scales follows: S_P = (S_K - 0.03) * (1.80655 / 1.805) and S_P =
S_C, however the accuracy of the latter is dependent on whether 
chlorinity or conductivity was used to determine the S_C value, with 
this inconsistency driving the development of PSS-78. The more precise 
standard names should be used where appropriate for both modelled and 
observed salinities. In particular, the use of sea_water_salinity to 
describe salinity observations made from 1978 onwards is now deprecated 
in favor of the term sea_water_practical_salinity which is the salinity 
quantity stored by national data centers for post-1978 observations. The
only exception to this is where the observed salinities are definitely 
known not to be recorded on the Practical Salinity Scale. The unit 
"parts per thousand" was used for sea_water_knudsen_salinity and 
sea_water_cox_salinity.

The sea surface skin temperature is the temperature measured by an 
infrared radiometer typically operating at wavelengths in the range 3.7 -
12 micrometers. It represents the temperature within the conductive 
diffusion-dominated sub-layer at a depth of approximately 10 - 20 
micrometers below the air-sea interface. Measurements of this quantity 
are subject to a large potential diurnal cycle including cool skin layer
effects (especially at night under clear skies and low wind speed

The sea surface subskin temperature is the temperature at the base of

For practical purposes, this quantity can be well approximated to the 
measurement of surface temperature by a microwave radiometer operating 
in the 6 - 11 gigahertz frequency range, but the relationship is neither
direct nor invariant to changing physical conditions or to the specific
geometry of the microwave measurements. Measurements of this quantity

coordinates (such as longitude and latitude), f is frequency and theta

sea_surface_wave_directional_variance_spectral_density.  S can be 
integrated over direction to give S1= integral(S dtheta) and this 
quantity has the standard name 
sea_surface_wave_variance_spectral_density.  Frequency moments, M(n) of 
S1 can then be calculated as follows: M(n) = integral(S1 f^n df), where 
f^n is f to the power of n.  The first wave period, T(m1)  is calculated
as the ratio M(0)/M(1).

Absolute
Salinity, S_A, is defined as part of the Thermodynamic Equation of 
Seawater 2010 (TEOS-10) which was adopted in 2010 by the 
Intergovernmental Oceanographic Commission (IOC). It is the mass 
fraction of dissolved material in sea water. Absolute Salinity 
incorporates the spatial variations in the composition of sea water. 
This type of Absolute Salinity is also called "Density Salinity". 
TEOS-10 estimates Absolute Salinity as the salinity variable that, when 
used with the TEOS-10 expression for density, yields the correct density
of a sea water sample even when the sample is not of Reference 
Composition. In practice, Absolute Salinity is often calculated from 
Practical Salinity using a spatial lookup table of pre-defined values of
the Absolute Salinity Anomaly. It is recommended that the version of 
(TEOS-10) software and the associated Absolute Salinity Anomaly 
climatology be specified within metadata by attaching a comment 
attribute to the data variable. Reference: www.teos-10.org; Millero et 
al., 2008 doi: 10.1016/j.dsr.2007.10.001. There are also standard names 
for the precisely defined salinity quantities

sea_water_preformed_salinity, S_*, and sea_water_reference_salinity.

Temperature is defined as part of the Thermodynamic Equation of

specific heat capacity of sea water, namely cp_0 = 3991.86795711963 J

"heat content" of sea water, by a factor of one hundred, than is 
potential temperature. Because of this, it can be regarded as being 
proportional to the heat content of sea water per unit mass. Reference:

Salinity, S_C, is defined unitless as a mass fraction per mil (0/00) or
"parts per thousand". S_C was the standard salinity measure from 1967

Chlorinity, Cl, is calculated from the conductivity of a sea water 
sample and since the work of the Joint Panel for Oceanographic Tables 
and Standards (JPOTS; 1966) is converted into Cox Salinity using S_C = 
1.80655Cl. This type of salinity was called simply "salinity" from 1967 
to 1978. Cox Salinity was replaced by Practical Salinity in 1978. Cox 
Salinity is converted to Practical Salinity following S_P = S_C, however
the accuracy of this is dependent on whether chlorinity or conductivity
was used to determine the S_C value, with this inconsistency driving 
the development of the Practical Salinity Scale 1978 (PSS-78).

Knudsen
Salinity, S_K, is defined unitless as a mass fraction per mil (0/00) or
"parts per thousand", and was calculated from the titration of 
inorganic salts from a sample of sea water after a commission to study 
the problem of determining salinity and density was initiated by the 
International Council for the Exploration of the Sea (ICES) in 1899. S_K
was the standard salinity measure until S_C (Cox Salinity) was 
established in 1967. Since the work of Knudsen (1901), chlorinity is 
converted into Knudsen Salinity using S_K = 0.030 + 1.805 Cl. This type 
of salinity was called simply "salinity" from 1901 to 1966. From the 
1960s on, electrical conductivity began to be used to estimate the 
Knudsen Salinity, rather than chemical titration. Knudsen Salinity was 
replaced by Cox Salinity in 1967 which was in turn replaced by Practical
Salinity, S_P, in 1978. Conversion of Knudsen Salinity to Practical 
Salinity follows S_P = (S_K - 0.03) * (1.80655 / 1.805). Reference:

"Neutral

density everywhere has a local slope that is close to the local slope of
the neutral tangent plane. At the sea surface in the equatorial Pacific
neutral density is very close to the potential density anomaly. At 
other locations, this is not the case. For example, along a neutral 
density surface there is a difference of up to 0.14 kg/m^3 in the 
potential density anomaly at the outcrops in the Southern and Northern

is the measure of acidity of seawater, defined as the negative 
logarithm of the activity of dissolved hydrogen ions plus bisulfate ions
in a sea water medium; it can be measured or calculated; when measured 
the scale is defined according to a series of buffers prepared in 
artificial seawater containing bisulfate.  The quantity may be written

Practical
Salinity, S_P, is defined on the Practical Salinity Scale of 1978 
(PSS-78) and is calculated from the electrical conductivity of sea water
(as well as temperature and pressure).  Officially S_P is dimensionless
so that, while convenient, and while it is common practice, it is not 
officially sanctioned to say S_P = 35 psu. Often authors use PSS-78, as 
in S_P = 35 PSS-78. If salinity was measured using remote sensing 
techniques and not conductivity, then it is recommended that additional 
metadata (calibration/validation information) be described in the 
variable comment attribute. This name should be used to describe 
salinity observations made from 1978 onwards (Practical Salinity is the 
salinity quantity stored by national data centres for post-1978 
observations). The only exception to this is where the observed 
salinities are definitely known not to be recorded on the Practical 
Salinity Scale.  There are also standard names for the precisely defined
salinity quantities sea_water_knudsen_salinity, S_K (used for salinity 
observations between 1901 and 1966), sea_water_cox_salinity, S_C (used 
for salinity observations between 1967 and 1977), 
sea_water_absolute_salinity, S_A, sea_water_preformed_salinity, S_*, and
sea_water_reference_salinity. Salinity quantities that do not match any
of the precise definitions should be given the more general standard 
name of sea_water_salinity.  Reference: www.teos-10.org; Lewis, 1980

Preformed
Salinity, S*, is defined as part of the Thermodynamic Equation of 
Seawater 2010 (TEOS-10) which was adopted in 2010 by the 
Intergovernmental Oceanographic Commission (IOC). Preformed Salinity is a
salinity variable that is designed to be as conservative as possible, 
by removing the estimated biogeochemical influences on the sea water 
composition. Preformed Salinity is Absolute Salinity, S_A (which has the
standard name sea_water_absolute_salinity), minus all contributions to 
sea water composition from biogeochemical processes. Preformed Salinity 
is the mass fraction of dissolved material in sea water. Reference:

Sea
water salinity is the salt content of sea water, often on the Practical
Salinity Scale of 1978. However, the unqualified term 'salinity' is 
generic and does not necessarily imply any particular method of 
calculation. The units of salinity are dimensionless and the units 
attribute should normally be given as 1e-3 or 0.001 i.e. parts per 
thousand. There are standard names for the more precisely defined 
salinity quantities: sea_water_knudsen_salinity, S_K (used for salinity 
observations between 1901 and 1966),  sea_water_cox_salinity, S_C (used 
for salinity observations between 1967 and 1977), 
sea_water_practical_salinity, S_P (used for salinity observations from 
1978 to the present day), sea_water_absolute_salinity, S_A, 
sea_water_preformed_salinity, S_*, and sea_water_reference_salinity. 
Practical Salinity is reported on the Practical Salinity Scale of 1978 
(PSS-78), and is usually based on the electrical conductivity of sea 
water in observations since the 1960s. Conversion of data between the 
observed scales follows: S_P = (S_K - 0.03) * (1.80655 / 1.805) and S_P =
S_C, however the accuracy of the latter is dependent on whether 
chlorinity or conductivity was used to determine the S_C value, with 
this inconsistency driving the development of PSS-78. The more precise 
standard names should be used where appropriate for both modelled and 
observed salinities. In particular, the use of sea_water_salinity to 
describe salinity observations made from 1978 onwards is now deprecated 
in favor of the term sea_water_practical_salinity which is the salinity 
quantity stored by national data centers for post-1978 observations. The
only exception to this is where the observed salinities are definitely 
known not to be recorded on the Practical Salinity Scale. The unit 
"parts per thousand" was used for sea_water_knudsen_salinity and 
sea_water_cox_salinity.

Sea
water temperature is the in situ temperature of the sea water. To 
specify the depth at which the temperature applies use a vertical 
coordinate variable or scalar coordinate variable. There are standard 
names for sea_surface_temperature, sea_surface_skin_temperature, 
sea_surface_subskin_temperature and sea_surface_foundation_temperature 
which can be used to describe data located at the specified surfaces. 
For observed data, depending on the period during which the observation 
was made, the measured in situ temperature was recorded against standard
"scales". These historical scales include the International Practical 
Temperature Scale of 1948 (IPTS-48; 1948-1967), the International 
Practical Temperature Scale of 1968 (IPTS-68, Barber, 1969; 1968-1989) 
and the International Temperature Scale of 1990 (ITS-90, Saunders 1990; 
1990 onwards). Conversion of data between these scales follows t68 = t48
- (4.4 x 10e-6) * t48(100 - t - 48); t90 = 0.99976 * t68. Observations 
made prior to 1948 (IPTS-48) have not been documented and therefore a 
conversion cannot be certain. Differences between t90 and t68 can be up 
to 0.01 at temperatures of 40 C and above; differences of 0.002-0.007 
occur across the standard range of ocean temperatures (-10 - 30 C). The 
International Equation of State of Seawater 1980 (EOS-80, UNESCO, 1981) 
and the Practical Salinity Scale (PSS-78) were both based on IPTS-68, 
while the Thermodynamic Equation of Seawater 2010 (TEOS-10) is based on 
ITS-90. References: Barber, 1969, doi: 10.1088/0026-1394/5/2/001;

<div id="sensor_zenith_angle_help" style="display: none; padding-left: 16px; margin-top: 4px; border-top: 1px dashed #cccccc;">
sensor_zenith_angle
is the angle between the line of sight to the sensor and the local 
zenith at the observation target. This angle is measured starting from 
directly overhead and its range is from zero (directly overhead the 
observation target) to 180 degrees (directly below the observation 
target). Local zenith is a line perpendicular to the Earth's surface at a
given location. "Observation target" means a location on the Earth 
defined by the sensor performing the observations.  A standard name also
exists for platform_zenith_angle, where "platform" refers to the 
vehicle from which observations are made e.g. aeroplane, ship, or 
satellite. For some viewing geometries the sensor and the platform 
cannot be assumed to be close enough to neglect the difference in 
calculated zenith angle.

matter decays. The decay process takes varying amounts of time depending
on the composition of the organic matter, the temperature and the 
availability of moisture. A carbon "soil pool" means the carbon 
contained in organic matter which has a characteristic period over which
it decays and releases carbon into the atmosphere. "Slow soil pool"

"Downward"
indicates a vector component which is positive when directed downward 
(negative upward).  The phrase 'expressed_as' is used in the 
construction A_expressed_as_B, where B is a chemical constituent of A. 
It means that the quantity indicated by the standard name is calculated 
solely with respect to the B contained in A, neglecting all other 
chemical constituents of A. "All land processes" means plant and soil 
respiration, photosynthesis, animal grazing, crop harvesting, natural 
fires and anthropogenic land use change. "Anthropogenic land use change"
means human changes to land, excluding forest regrowth. It includes 
fires ignited by humans for the purpose of land use change and the 
processes of eventual disposal and decomposition of wood products such 
as paper, cardboard, furniture and timber for construction. The quantity
with standard name 
surface_net_downward_mass_flux_of_carbon_dioxide_expressed_as_carbon_due_to_all_land_processes
is  equal to the difference  between the quantities with standard names
surface_net_downward_mass_flux_of_carbon_dioxide_expressed_as_carbon_due_to_all_land_processes_excluding_anthropogenic_land_use_change
and 
surface_net_upward_mass_flux_of_carbon_dioxide_expressed_as_carbon_due_to_emission_from_anthropogenic_land_use_change.
In accordance with common usage in geophysical disciplines, "flux" 
implies per unit area, called "flux density" in physics.  The 
specification of a physical process by the phrase due_to_process means 
that the quantity named is a single term in a sum of terms which 
together compose the general quantity named by omitting the phrase.  The
chemical formula for carbon dioxide is CO2.

with a coordinate of angle_of_emergence.  Radiative flux is the sum of 
shortwave and longwave radiative fluxes.  When thought of as being 
incident on a surface, a radiative flux is sometimes called 
"irradiance".   In relation to satellite ocean color products the 
quantity named 
surface_ratio_of_upwelling_radiance_emerging_from_sea_water_to_downwelling_radiative_flux_in_air
is sometimes called "remote sensing reflectance" and has a  
bidirectional dependence. The direction of the downwelling flux can be 
specified using a coordinate with the standard name angle_of_incidence.

The
surface called "surface" means the lower boundary of the atmosphere. 
Upwelling radiation is radiation from below. It does not mean "net 
upward". Radiance is the radiative flux in a particular direction, per 
unit of solid angle. The direction towards which it is going must be 
specified, for instance with a coordinate of zenith_angle. If the 
radiation does not depend on direction, a standard name of isotropic 
radiance should be chosen instead.

air lifted adiabatically from a starting air pressure to a finishing air
pressure in the troposphere and the ambient air temperature at the 
finishing air pressure in the troposphere. It is often called the lifted
index (LI) and provides a measure of the instability of the atmosphere.
The air parcel is "lifted" by moving the air parcel from the starting 
air pressure to the Lifting Condensation Level (dry adiabatically) and 
then from the Lifting Condensation Level to the finishing air pressure 
(wet adiabatically). Air temperature is the bulk temperature of the air.

Evaporation
is the conversion of liquid or solid into vapor.  (The conversion of 
solid alone into vapor is called "sublimation".)  The quantity with 
standard name 
temperature_flux_due_to_evaporation_expressed_as_heat_flux_out_of_sea_water
is the heat energy carried by the transfer of water away from the 
liquid ocean through the process of evaporation.  It is distinct from 
the transfer of latent heat and is calculated relative to the heat that 
would be transported by water evaporating at zero degrees Celsius. It is
calculated as the product QevapCpTevap, where Qevap is the mass flux of
evaporating water (kg m-2 s-1), Cp is the specific heat capacity of 
water and Tevap is the temperature in degrees Celsius of the evaporating
water. In accordance with common usage in geophysical disciplines,

"tendency_of_X"
means derivative of X with respect to time. "Content" indicates a 
quantity per unit area. The "atmosphere content" of a quantity refers to
the vertical integral from the surface to the top of the atmosphere. 
For the content between specified levels in the atmosphere, standard 
names including "content_of_atmosphere_layer" are used. The mass is the 
total mass of the molecules. The specification of a physical process by 
the phrase "due_to_" process means that the quantity named is a single 
term in a sum of terms which together compose the general quantity named
by omitting the phrase. "Emission" means emission from a primary source
located anywhere within the atmosphere, including at the lower boundary
(i.e. earth's surface). "Emission" is a process entirely distinct from 
"re-emission" which is used in some standard names. The chemical formula
of carbon monoxide is CO. The "industrial processes and combustion" 
sector comprises fuel combustion activities related to manufacturing 
industries and construction, industrial processes related to mineral 
products, the chemical industry, metal production, the production of 
pulp, paper, food and drink, and non-energy industry use of lubricants 
and waxes. It may also include any not-classified or "other" combustion,
which is commonly included in industry-related inventory data. 
"Industrial processes and combustion" is the term used in standard names
to describe a collection of emission sources. A variable which has this
value for the standard_name attribute should be accompanied by a 
comment attribute which lists the source categories and provides a 
reference to the categorization scheme, for example, "IPCC 
(Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change) source categories 1A2, 2A, 
2B, 2C, 2D and 2G as defined in the 2006 IPCC guidelines for national 
greenhouse gas inventories".

"tendency_of_X"
means derivative of X with respect to time. "Content" indicates a 
quantity per unit area. The "atmosphere content" of a quantity refers to
the vertical integral from the surface to the top of the atmosphere. 
For the content between specified levels in the atmosphere, standard 
names including "content_of_atmosphere_layer" are used. The mass is the 
total mass of the molecules. The specification of a physical process by

chemistry are chemical compounds derived by reacting an oxoacid with a 
hydroxyl compound such as an alcohol or phenol. Esters are usually 
derived from an inorganic acid or organic acid in which at least one -OH
(hydroxyl) group is replaced by an -O-alkyl (alkoxy) group, and most 
commonly from carboxylic acids and alcohols. That is, esters are formed 
by condensing an acid with an alcohol. In standard names "esters" is the
term used to describe the group of ester species that are represented 
within a given model. The list of individual species that are included 
in a quantity having a group chemical standard name can vary between 
models. Where possible, the data variable should be accompanied by a 
complete description of the species represented, for example, by using a
comment attribute. The "land transport" sector includes fuel combustion
activities related to road transportation, railways and other 
transportation.  "Land transport" is the term used in standard names to 
describe a collection of emission sources. A variable which has this 
value for the standard_name attribute should be accompanied by a comment
attribute which lists the source categories and provides a reference to
the categorization scheme, for example, "IPCC (Intergovernmental Panel

"tendency_of_X"
means derivative of X with respect to time. "Content" indicates a 
quantity per unit area. The "atmosphere content" of a quantity refers to
the vertical integral from the surface to the top of the atmosphere. 
For the content between specified levels in the atmosphere, standard 
names including "content_of_atmosphere_layer" are used. The mass is the 
total mass of the molecules. The specification of a physical process by 
the phrase "due_to_" process means that the quantity named is a single 
term in a sum of terms which together compose the general quantity named
by omitting the phrase. "Emission" means emission from a primary source
located anywhere within the atmosphere, including at the lower boundary
(i.e. earth's surface). "Emission" is a process entirely distinct from 
"re-emission" which is used in some standard names. Esters in organic 
chemistry are chemical compounds derived by reacting an oxoacid with a 
hydroxyl compound such as an alcohol or phenol. Esters are usually 
derived from an inorganic acid or organic acid in which at least one -OH
(hydroxyl) group is replaced by an -O-alkyl (alkoxy) group, and most 
commonly from carboxylic acids and alcohols. That is, esters are formed 
by condensing an acid with an alcohol. In standard names "esters" is the
term used to describe the group of ester species that are represented 
within a given model. The list of individual species that are included 
in a quantity having a group chemical standard name can vary between 
models. Where possible, the data variable should be accompanied by a 
complete description of the species represented, for example, by using a
comment attribute. The "solvent production and use" sector comprises 
industrial processes related to the consumption of halocarbons, SF6, 
solvent and other product use. "Solvent production and use" is the term 
used in standard names to describe a collection of emission sources. A 
variable which has this value for the standard_name attribute should be 
accompanied by a comment attribute which lists the source categories and
provides a reference to the categorization scheme, for example, "IPCC 
(Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change) source categories 2F and 3 
as defined in the 2006 IPCC guidelines for national greenhouse gas 
inventories".

"tendency_of_X"
means derivative of X with respect to time. "Content" indicates a 
quantity per unit area. The "atmosphere content" of a quantity refers to
the vertical integral from the surface to the top of the atmosphere. 
For the content between specified levels in the atmosphere, standard 
names including "content_of_atmosphere_layer" are used. The mass is the 
total mass of the molecules. The specification of a physical process by 
the phrase "due_to_" process means that the quantity named is a single 
term in a sum of terms which together compose the general quantity named
by omitting the phrase. "Emission" means emission from a primary source
located anywhere within the atmosphere, including at the lower boundary
(i.e. earth's surface). "Emission" is a process entirely distinct from 
"re-emission" which is used in some standard names. The chemical formula
for ethane is C2H6. Ethane is a member of the group of hydrocarbons 
known as alkanes. There are standard names for the alkane group as well 
as for some of the individual species. The "waste treatment and 
disposal" sector comprises solid waste disposal on land, wastewater 
handling, waste incineration and other waste disposal. "Waste treatment 
and disposal" is the term used in standard names to describe a 
collection of emission sources. A variable which has this value for the 
standard_name attribute should be accompanied by a comment attribute 
which lists the source categories and provides a reference to the 
categorization scheme, for example, "IPCC (Intergovernmental Panel on 
Climate Change) source categories 6A, 6B, 6C and 6D as defined in the 
2006 IPCC guidelines for national greenhouse gas inventories".

quantity per unit area. The "atmosphere content" of a quantity refers to
the vertical integral from the surface to the top of the atmosphere. 
For the content between specified levels in the atmosphere, standard 
names including "content_of_atmosphere_layer" are used. The mass is the 
total mass of the molecules. The specification of a physical process by 
the phrase "due_to_" process means that the quantity named is a single 
term in a sum of terms which together compose the general quantity named
by omitting the phrase. "Emission" means emission from a primary source
located anywhere within the atmosphere, including at the lower boundary
(i.e. earth's surface). "Emission" is a process entirely distinct from 
"re-emission" which is used in some standard names. Ethers are a class 
of organic compounds that contain an ether group - an oxygen atom 
connected to two alkyl or aryl groups - of general formula R-O-R. In 
standard names "ethers" is the term used to describe the group of ether 
species that are represented within a given model. The list of 
individual species that are included in a quantity having a group 
chemical standard name can vary between models. Where possible, the data
variable should be accompanied by a complete description of the species
represented, for example, by using a comment attribute. The 
"agricultural production" sector comprises the agricultural processes of
enteric fermentation, manure management, rice cultivation, agricultural
soils and other. It may also include any not-classified or "other" 
combustion, which is commonly included in agriculture-related inventory 
data. "Agricultural production" is the term used in standard names to 
describe a collection of emission sources. A variable which has this 
value for the standard_name attribute should be accompanied by a comment
attribute which lists the source categories and provides a reference to
the categorization scheme, for example, "IPCC (Intergovernmental Panel 
on Climate Change) source categories 4A, 4B, 4C, 4D and 4G as defined in
the 2006 IPCC guidelines for national greenhouse gas inventories".

"tendency_of_X"
means derivative of X with respect to time. "Content" indicates a 
quantity per unit area. The "atmosphere content" of a quantity refers to
the vertical integral from the surface to the top of the atmosphere. 
For the content between specified levels in the atmosphere, standard 
names including "content_of_atmosphere_layer" are used. The mass is the 
total mass of the molecules. The specification of a physical process by 
the phrase "due_to_" process means that the quantity named is a single 
term in a sum of terms which together compose the general quantity named
by omitting the phrase. "Emission" means emission from a primary source
located anywhere within the atmosphere, including at the lower boundary
(i.e. earth's surface). "Emission" is a process entirely distinct from 
"re-emission" which is used in some standard names. The chemical formula
for formaldehyde is CH2O. The IUPAC name for formaldehyde is methanal. 
The "residential and commercial combustion" sector comprises fuel 
combustion activities related to the commercial/institutional sector, 
the residential sector and the agriculture/forestry/fishing sector. It 
may also include any not-classified or "other" combustion, which is 
commonly included in the inventory data. "Residential and commercial 
combustion" is the term used in standard names to describe a collection 
of emission sources. A variable which has this value for the 
standard_name attribute should be accompanied by a comment attribute 
which lists the source categories and provides a reference to the 
categorization scheme, for example, "IPCC (Intergovernmental Panel on 
Climate Change) source categories 1A4a, 1A4b and 1A4c as defined in the 
2006 IPCC guidelines for national greenhouse gas inventories".

The "savanna and grassland fires" sector comprises the burning (natural 
and human-induced) of living or dead vegetation in non-forested areas. 
It excludes field burning of agricultural residues. "Savanna and 
grassland fires" is the term used in standard names to describe a 
collection of emission sources. A variable which has this value for the

due_to_process means that the quantity named is a  single term in a sum 
of terms which together compose the general quantity  named by omitting 
the phrase.  "tendency_of_X" means derivative of X with respect to time.
"Emission" means emission from a primary source located anywhere 
within the atmosphere, including at the lower boundary (i.e. earth's 
surface). "Emission" is a process entirely distinct from "re-emission" 
which is used in some standard names. The chemical formula for HCFC22 is
CHClF2.  The IUPAC name for HCFC22 is chloro-difluoro-methane.

as for some of the individual species. The "energy production and 
distribution" sector comprises fuel combustion activities related to 
energy industries and fugitive emissions from fuels. It may also include
any not-classified or "other" combustion, which is commonly included in
energy-related inventory data. "Energy production and distribution" is 
the term used in standard names to describe a collection of emission 
sources. A variable which has this value for the standard_name attribute
should be accompanied by a comment attribute which lists the source 
categories and provides a reference to the categorization scheme, for 
example, "IPCC (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change) source

"Content"
indicates a quantity per unit area.  The "atmosphere content" of a 
quantity refers to the vertical integral from the surface to the top of 
the atmosphere. For the content between specified levels in the 
atmosphere, standard names including content_of_atmosphere_layer are 
used.  "Aerosol" means the suspended liquid or solid particles in air 
(except cloud droplets).  Aerosol takes up ambient water (a process 
known as hygroscopic growth) depending on the relative humidity and the 
composition of the aerosol. "Dry aerosol" means aerosol without water. 
The specification of a physical process by the phrase due_to_process 
means that the quantity named is a  single term in a sum of terms which 
together compose the general quantity  named by omitting the phrase.  
"tendency_of_X" means derivative of X with respect to time.  "Dry 
deposition" is the sum of turbulent deposition and gravitational 
settling. The chemical formula for the nitrate anion is NO3-.

"tendency_of_X"
means derivative of X with respect to time. "Content" indicates a 
quantity per unit area. The "atmosphere content" of a quantity refers to
the vertical integral from the surface to the top of the atmosphere. 
For the content between specified levels in the atmosphere, standard 
names including "content_of_atmosphere_layer" are used. The mass is the 
total mass of the molecules. The specification of a physical process by 
the phrase "due_to_" process means that the quantity named is a single 
term in a sum of terms which together compose the general quantity named
by omitting the phrase. "Emission" means emission from a primary source
located anywhere within the atmosphere, including at the lower boundary
(i.e. earth's surface). "Emission" is a process entirely distinct from 
"re-emission" which is used in some standard names. "nmvoc" means non 
methane volatile organic compounds. The "savanna and grassland fires" 
sector comprises the burning (natural and human-induced) of living or 
dead vegetation in non-forested areas. It excludes field burning of 
agricultural residues. "Savanna and grassland fires" is the term used in
standard names to describe a collection of emission sources. A variable
which has this value for the standard_name attribute should be 
accompanied by a comment attribute which lists the source categories and
provides a reference to the categorization scheme, for example, "IPCC 
(Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change) source category 5 as defined
in the 2006 IPCC guidelines for national greenhouse gas inventories".

"tendency_of_X"
means derivative of X with respect to time. "Content" indicates a 
quantity per unit area. The "atmosphere content" of a quantity refers to
the vertical integral from the surface to the top of the atmosphere. 
For the content between specified levels in the atmosphere, standard 
names including "content_of_atmosphere_layer" are used. The 
specification of a physical process by the phrase "due_to" process means
that the quantity named is a single term in a sum of terms which 
together compose the general quantity named by omitting the phrase. 
"Emission" means emission from a primary source located anywhere within 
the atmosphere, including at the lower boundary (i.e. earth's surface). 
"Emission" is a process entirely distinct from "re-emission" which is 
used in some standard names. "Nox" means a combination of two radical 
species containing nitrogen and oxygen: NO+NO2. The phrase 
'expressed_as' is used in the construction A_expressed_as_B, where B is a
chemical constituent of A. It means that the quantity indicated by the 
standard name is calculated solely with respect to the B contained in A,
neglecting all other chemical constituents of A. The "savanna and 
grassland fires" sector comprises the burning (natural and 
human-induced) of living or dead vegetation in non-forested areas. It 
excludes field burning of agricultural residues. "Savanna and grassland 
fires" is the term used in standard names to describe a collection of 
emission sources. A variable which has this value for the standard_name 
attribute should be accompanied by a comment attribute which lists the 
source categories and provides a reference to the categorization scheme,
for example, "IPCC (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change) source 
category 5 as defined in the 2006 IPCC guidelines for national 
greenhouse gas inventories".

"Content"
indicates a quantity per unit area.  The "atmosphere content" of a 
quantity refers to the vertical integral from the surface to the top of 
the atmosphere. For the content between specified levels in the 
atmosphere, standard names including content_of_atmosphere_layer are 
used.  "Aerosol" means the suspended liquid or solid particles in air 
(except cloud droplets).  The specification of a physical process by the
phrase due_to_process means that the quantity named is a  single term 
ina sum of terms which together compose the general quantity  named by 
omitting the phrase."tendency_of_X" means derivative of X  with respect

"Content"
indicates a quantity per unit area.  The "atmosphere content" of a 
quantity refers to the vertical integral from the surface to the top of 
the atmosphere. For the content between specified levels in the 
atmosphere, standard names including content_of_atmosphere_layer are 
used.  The specification of a physical process by the phrase 
due_to_process means that the quantity named is a  single term in a sum 
of terms which together compose the general quantity  named by omitting 
the phrase.  "tendency_of_X" means derivative of X with respect to time.
"Dry deposition" is the sum of turbulent deposition and gravitational 
settling. The chemical formula for peroxyacetyl nitrate, sometimes 
referred to as PAN, is CH3COO2NO2.  The IUPAC name for 
peroxyacetyl_nitrate is nitroethaneperoxoate.

indicates a quantity per unit area.  The "atmosphere content" of a 
quantity refers to the vertical integral from the surface to the top of 
the atmosphere. For the content between specified levels in the 
atmosphere, standard names including content_of_atmosphere_layer are 
used.  The specification of a physical process by the phrase 
due_to_process means that the quantity named is a  single term in a sum 
of terms which together compose the general quantity  named by omitting 
the phrase.  "tendency_of_X" means derivative of X with respect to time.
"Emission" means emission from a primary source located anywhere 
within the atmosphere, including at the lower boundary (i.e. earth's 
surface). "Emission" is a process entirely distinct from "re-emission" 
which is used in some standard names. The chemical symbol for radon is 
Rn.

"tendency_of_X"
means derivative of X with respect to time. "Content" indicates a 
quantity per unit area. The "atmosphere content" of a quantity refers to
the vertical integral from the surface to the top of the atmosphere. 
For the content between specified levels in the atmosphere, standard 
names including "content_of_atmosphere_layer" are used. The mass is the 
total mass of the molecules. The specification of a physical process by 
the phrase "due_to_" process means that the quantity named is a single 
term in a sum of terms which together compose the general quantity named
by omitting the phrase. "Emission" means emission from a primary source
located anywhere within the atmosphere, including at the lower boundary
(i.e. earth's surface). "Emission" is a process entirely distinct from 
"re-emission" which is used in some standard names. The chemical formula
for sulfur dioxide is SO2. The "agricultural waste burning" sector 
comprises field burning of agricultural residues. "Agricultural waste 
burning" is the term used in standard names to describe a collection of 
emission sources. A variable which has this value for the standard_name 
attribute should be accompanied by a comment attribute which lists the 
source categories and provides a reference to the categorization scheme,
for example, "IPCC (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change) source

by omitting the phrase. "Emission" means emission from a primary source
located anywhere within the atmosphere, including at the lower boundary
(i.e. earth's surface). "Emission" is a process entirely distinct from 
"re-emission" which is used in some standard names. The chemical formula
for xylene is C6H4C2H6. In chemistry, xylene is a generic term for a 
group of three isomers of dimethylbenzene. The IUPAC names for the 
isomers are 1,2-dimethylbenzene, 1,3-dimethylbenzene and 
1,4-dimethylbenzene. Xylene is an aromatic hydrocarbon. There are 
standard names that refer to aromatic_compounds as a group, as well as 
those for individual species. The "residential and commercial 
combustion" sector comprises fuel combustion activities related to the 
commercial/institutional sector, the residential sector and the 
agriculture/forestry/fishing sector. It may also include any 
not-classified or "other" combustion, which is commonly included in the 
inventory data. "Residential and commercial combustion" is the term used
in standard names to describe a collection of emission sources. A 
variable which has this value for the standard_name attribute should be 
accompanied by a comment attribute which lists the source categories and
provides a reference to the categorization scheme, for example, "IPCC 
(Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change) source categories 1A4a, 1A4b
and 1A4c as defined in the 2006 IPCC guidelines for national greenhouse
gas inventories".

of inorganic chlorine compounds with the exception of  hydrogen chloride
(HCl) and chlorine nitrate (ClONO2). "Clox" is the term used in 
standard names for all species belonging to the family that are 
represented within a given model. The list of individual species that 
are included in a quantity with a group chemical standard name can vary 
between models.  Where possible, the data variable should be accompanied
by a complete description of the species represented, for example, by 
using a comment attribute. "Inorganic chlorine", sometimes referred to 
as Cly, describes a family of chemical species which result from the 
degradation of source gases containing chlorine (CFCs, HCFCs, VSLS) and 
natural inorganic chlorine sources such as seasalt and other aerosols.  
Standard names that use the term "inorganic_chlorine" are used for 
quantities that contain all inorganic chlorine species including HCl and
ClONO2. The phrase 'expressed_as' is used in the construction 
A_expressed_as_B, where B is a chemical constituent of A. It means that 
the quantity indicated by the standard name is calculated solely with 
respect to the B contained in A, neglecting all other chemical 
constituents of A.

"tendency_of_X"
means derivative of X with respect to time. "Content" indicates a 
quantity per unit area. "Layer" means any layer with upper and lower 
boundaries that have constant values in some vertical coordinate. There 
must be a vertical coordinate variable indicating the extent of the 
layer(s). If the layers are model layers, the vertical coordinate can be
model_level_number, but it is recommended to specify a physical 
coordinate (in a scalar or auxiliary coordinate variable) as well. Dry 
energy is the sum of dry static energy and kinetic energy. Dry static 
energy is the sum of enthalpy and potential energy (itself the sum of 
gravitational and centripetal potential energy). Enthalpy can be written
either as (1) CpT, where Cp is heat capacity at constant pressure, T is
absolute temperature, or (2) U+pV, where U is internal energy, p is 
pressure and V is volume.

The
specification of a physical process by the phrase due_to_process means 
that the quantity named is a single term in a sum of terms which 
together compose the general quantity named by omitting the phrase. 
"tendency_of_X" means derivative of X with respect to time. "Content" 
indicates a quantity per unit area. "Layer" means any layer with upper 
and lower boundaries that have constant values in some vertical 
coordinate. There must be a vertical coordinate variable indicating the 
extent of the layer(s). If the layers are model layers, the vertical 
coordinate can be model_level_number, but it is recommended to specify a
physical coordinate (in a scalar or auxiliary coordinate variable) as 
well.

"tendency_of_X"
means derivative of X with respect to time. Sea water salinity is the 
salt content of sea water, often on the Practical Salinity Scale of 
1978. However, the unqualified term 'salinity' is generic and does not 
necessarily imply any particular method of calculation. The units of 
salinity are dimensionless and normally given as 1e-3 or 0.001 i.e. 
parts per thousand. There are standard names for the more precisely 
defined salinity quantities: sea_water_knudsen_salinity, S_K (used for 
salinity observations between 1901 and 1966), sea_water_cox_salinity, 
S_C (used for salinity observations between 1967 and 1977), 
sea_water_practical_salinity, S_P (used for salinity observations from 
1978 to the present day), sea_water_absolute_salinity, S_A, 
sea_water_preformed_salinity, S_*, and sea_water_reference_salinity. 
Practical Salinity is reported on the Practical Salinity Scale of 1978 
(PSS-78), and is usually based on the electrical conductivity of sea 
water in observations since the 1960s. Conversion of data between the 
observed scales follows: S_P = (S_K - 0.03) * (1.80655 / 1.805) and S_P =
S_C, however the accuracy of the latter is dependent on whether 
chlorinity or conductivity was used to determine the S_C value, with 
this inconsistency driving the development of PSS-78. The more precise 
standard names should be used where appropriate for both modelled and 
observed salinities. In particular, the use of sea_water_salinity to 
describe salinity observations made from 1978 onwards is now deprecated 
in favor of the term sea_water_practical_salinity which is the salinity 
quantity stored by national data centers for post-1978 observations. The
only exception to this is where the observed salinities are definitely 
known not to be recorded on the Practical Salinity Scale. The unit 
"parts per thousand" was used for sea_water_knudsen_salinity and

"tendency_of_X"
means derivative of X with respect to time. "Horizontal mixing" means 
any horizontal transport other than by advection and bolus advection, 
usually represented as horizontal diffusion in ocean models. The 
specification of a physical process by the phrase due_to_process means 
that the quantity named is a single term in a sum of terms which 
together compose the general quantity named by omitting the phrase. Sea 
water salinity is the salt content of sea water, often on the Practical 
Salinity Scale of 1978. However, the unqualified term 'salinity' is 
generic and does not necessarily imply any particular method of 
calculation. The units of salinity are dimensionless and normally given 
as 1e-3 or 0.001 i.e. parts per thousand. There are standard names for 
the more precisely defined salinity quantities: 
sea_water_knudsen_salinity, S_K (used for salinity observations between 
1901 and 1966), sea_water_cox_salinity, S_C (used for salinity 
observations between 1967 and 1977), sea_water_practical_salinity, S_P 
(used for salinity observations from 1978 to the present day), 
sea_water_absolute_salinity, S_A, sea_water_preformed_salinity, S_*, and
sea_water_reference_salinity. Practical Salinity is reported on the 
Practical Salinity Scale of 1978 (PSS-78), and is usually based on the 
electrical conductivity of sea water in observations since the 1960s. 
Conversion of data between the observed scales follows: S_P = (S_K - 
0.03) * (1.80655 / 1.805) and S_P = S_C, however the accuracy of the 
latter is dependent on whether chlorinity or conductivity was used to 
determine the S_C value, with this inconsistency driving the development
of PSS-78. The more precise standard names should be used where 
appropriate for both modelled and observed salinities. In particular, 
the use of sea_water_salinity to describe salinity observations made 
from 1978 onwards is now deprecated in favor of the term 
sea_water_practical_salinity which is the salinity quantity stored by 
national data centers for post-1978 observations. The only exception to 
this is where the observed salinities are definitely known not to be 
recorded on the Practical Salinity Scale. The unit "parts per thousand" 
was used for sea_water_knudsen_salinity and sea_water_cox_salinity.

of the reference sensor and TOA brightness temperature of the
monitored sensor. This TOA brightness temperature difference is a 
measure of the calibration difference between the monitored and 
reference sensors. The standard scene is a target area with typical 
Earth surface and atmospheric conditions that is accepted as a 
reference. Brightness temperature of a body is the temperature of a 
black body which radiates the same power per unit solid angle per unit 
area at a given wavenumber. TOA brightness temperature of the standard 
scene is calculated using a radiative transfer simulation for a given 
viewing geometry. The resultant top-of-atmosphere spectral radiance is 
then integrated with each sensor's spectral response function and 
converted to equivalent brightness temperature. The specification of a 
physical process by the phrase "due_to_" process means that the quantity
named is a single term in a sum of terms which together compose the 
general quantity named by omitting the phrase.

The
virtual_salt_flux_into_sea_water_due_to_process is the salt flux that 
would have the same effect on the sea surface salinity as 
water_flux_out_of_sea_water_due_to_process. In accordance with common 
usage in geophysical disciplines, "flux" implies per unit area, called 
"flux density" in physics.  The specification of a physical process by 
the phrase due_to_process means that the quantity named is a  single 
term in a sum of terms which together compose the general quantity  
named by omitting the phrase.  "Sea ice thermodynamics" refers to the 
addition or subtraction of mass due to surface and basal fluxes, i.e., 
due to melting, sublimation and fusion.

Downwelling
radiation is radiation from above. It does not mean "net downward". 
Radiative flux is the sum of shortwave and longwave radiative fluxes. 
When thought of as being incident on a surface, a radiative flux is

"component_derivative_of_X"
means the derivative of X with respect to distance in the component 
direction, which may be northward, southward, eastward, westward, x or 
y. The last two indicate derivatives along the axes of the grid,  
whether or not they are true longitude and latitude. 
x_derivative_of_ocean_rigid_lid_pressure means (d/dx) of the ocean 
surface pressure, as derived by a rigid lid approximation, keeping the 
other horizontal coordinate (y, presumably) constant.

"x"
indicates a vector component along the grid x-axis, positive with 
increasing x. The specification of a physical process by the phrase 
due_to_process means that the quantity named is a single term in a sum 
of terms which together compose the general quantity named by omitting 
the phrase. In accordance with common usage in geophysical disciplines, 
"flux" implies per unit area, called "flux density" in physics.
